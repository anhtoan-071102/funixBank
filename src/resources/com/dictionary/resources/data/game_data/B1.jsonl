{"id": 56, "title": "Helen Skelton", "text": "Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed various dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a tiny boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 metres above the ground, between the two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms.\nHelen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. \u2018The training was a shock\u2019, said Helen. \u2018I didn\u2019t realise how strong I\u2019d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped I could carry on. Every time I fell on the wire it hurt badly. But it was essential to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!\u2019\nThe day of the actual challenge was windy and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-metre walk took 15 minutes. \u2018That was the scariest thing I\u2019ve done,\u2019 she admitted afterwards. \u2018I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over!\u2019\nThe experience has not prevented Helen, however, from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite and bike.", "level": "B1", "diff": 62.972, "fac": 0.5472, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What is the writer doing in this text?", "answer": "c", "diff": 55.71, "disc": 0.379, "fac": 0.713, "options": {"a": {"text": "introducing a new television presenter", "disc": -0.16, "fac": 0.05}, "b": {"text": "getting support for a charity project", "disc": -0.26, "fac": 0.19}, "c": {"text": "describing a woman\u2019s achievement", "disc": 0.38, "fac": 0.71}, "d": {"text": "recommending a television programme", "disc": -0.02, "fac": 0.03}}}, "2": {"text": "Helen knew she would be safe if she fell because", "answer": "c", "diff": 70.0, "disc": 0.268, "fac": 0.388, "options": {"a": {"text": "she had a net that could catch her.", "disc": -0.14, "fac": 0.06}, "b": {"text": "she had a stick to support herself with.", "disc": -0.08, "fac": 0.5}, "c": {"text": "she was wearing special equipment.", "disc": 0.27, "fac": 0.39}, "d": {"text": "she was quite close to the ground.", "disc": -0.11, "fac": 0.02}}}, "3": {"text": "During her training, Helen was surprised to find that", "answer": "b", "diff": 67.65, "disc": 0.296, "fac": 0.442, "options": {"a": {"text": "staying on the wire was so difficult.", "disc": -0.12, "fac": 0.37}, "b": {"text": "she had to work so hard at her fitness.", "disc": 0.3, "fac": 0.44}, "c": {"text": "it was so important to be confident.", "disc": -0.06, "fac": 0.12}, "d": {"text": "her circus skills were so useful.", "disc": -0.2, "fac": 0.06}}}, "4": {"text": "When Helen performed her work on the high wire", "answer": "d", "diff": 54.51, "disc": 0.436, "fac": 0.736, "options": {"a": {"text": "she was sorry to get to the end.", "disc": -0.02, "fac": 0.03}, "b": {"text": "the weather conditions were perfect.", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.06}, "c": {"text": "it took less time than expected.", "disc": -0.25, "fac": 0.16}, "d": {"text": "she managed to keep herself calm.", "disc": 0.44, "fac": 0.74}}}, "5": {"text": "What might Helen say about the walk?", "answer": "d", "diff": 66.99, "disc": 0.212, "fac": 0.457, "options": {"a": {"text": "The view from the high wire was fantastic \u2013 I loved every minute of it.

He had already written a book about his experiences travelling round Canada in a 50-year-old car and was mad about motor sport and had a job building racing car engines. To save money Jeff rode to work on an old bicycle, which he also used to go to Amsterdam on holiday. \u2018That trip opened my eyes,\u2019 he says. \u2018I decided to see the world by bike.\u2019\nJeff didn\u2019t want a normal touring bike and he knew he wanted to build one himself. \u2018The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.\u2019  After two false starts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to turn back because of a knee injury, he finally set out in 2006. He was away for three years, having travelled through 23 countries on four continents.\nThe best bit of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. \u2018Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn\u2019t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.\u2019 His worst moment came when he had to drink some dirty water from a stream. A serious fever left him in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for either hospital bills or the journey home.

And we\u2019ve just started using an exciting piece of equipment called a \u2018night-vision scope\u2019, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark! \nWe\u2019re worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s enough food on the east coast for these animals. There\u2019s lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven\u2019t had the equipment. But this new \u2018scope\u2019 will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we\u2019ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn.\nIt is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We\u2019ve studied ducks in different locations, and I\u2019ve had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn\u2019t helped \u2013 some nights are mild, but more often it\u2019s wet. Oh, and it\u2019s so quiet I\u2019ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We\u2019ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. \nStill I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring \u2013 hours in a laboratory, where we\u2019ll look at our results together.

{"id": 60, "title": "Circus Experience", "text": "Have you ever wondered what it\u2019s like performing in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience - a centre teaching young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes so many skills, from juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, to trapeze, which involves flying through the air above an amazed audience.  On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.\nSophia explains \u201cFor a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time \u2013 it\u2019s vital to keep performances fresh and full of action. If you aim to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another brilliant side of things is friendship with other performers, and the chance to learn from them. Being fit is also really important - circus artists, like athletes, train daily to keep strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills. People often think you\u2019re likely to suffer injuries, or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is looking ahead because you can only be on the road while you\u2019re young and then you really need to consider other options.\u201d\nThe course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences.

These satchels now sell in world-famous shops, and are the bag chosen by many celebrities. \nBefore choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses, from cake decorating to party planning, considering her options, rather than going with her first idea. Once she\u2019d decided, she found not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, \u2018Many said there was no demand for them \u2013 but I was convinced.\u2019 She involved family from the start, working with her mother, who\u2019d never had a career, but has a natural business ability, and the design came from children\u2019s story books.\nAlthough Julie didn\u2019t know much about fashion blogs, they\u2019ve been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they\u2019d comment in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed her company produces the satchels. Julie now loves waiting to see which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for original styles, keeping her products new and exciting.\nThere was a challenging time when a company producing satchels copied Julie\u2019s design to sell similar products, as a result she now makes sure she\u2019s as confident in the production team as she is in her own staff. Visitors comment on the positive feeling in her offices \u2013 people love working there, There\u2019s now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it\u2019s the team who make it a special place.

Vicky chose to do lots of different sports. She was a good swimmer, and the coach at the swimming club she went to thought she might be good enough to become a champion. But the club was a long way from her home so it was difficult for her to fit in the training around her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought himself a special track racing bike and started taking part in competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it for herself. She says that was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing really well. The track was near her school, which meant it was no problem for her to attend training sessions after school every day.\nVicky went on to have a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, when she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky told me: \u2018For years I\u2019d loved winning competitions but I began to get a bit tired of the whole thing \u2013 and when the excitement stops, there\u2019s no point. Luckily, I went on to have a new career.\u2019\nVicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. \u2018We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,\u2019 she says. \u2018The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to learn to believe in themselves and their own abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it gets young people together so they\u2019re part of a wider group.\u2019\nThe charity uses celebrities to advertise the work they do. Vicky says, \u2018I know some people aren\u2019t sure whether the support of a celebrity is always positive for a charity. They say the celebrities are only doing it to push themselves forward, which prevents the public from seeing the real work of the charity.

Although her parents weren\u2019t musicians, there was always music in the house. Her grandfather played the guitar, and taught Ana and her brother to play.\nThe first time Ana tried singing in front of an audience was at school \u2013 she was so nervous that her teacher had to lead her off the stage. This teacher suggested that joining the school theatre club might make her more confident. After attending the club for a while, she happily sang with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. \nA year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them, and so she wrote her first ever song, Falling Stars. Writing it took just three days and she enjoyed it so much that she enrolled on a songwriting course run by a professional songwriter. Despite being the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of the others.  But Ana says the teacher didn\u2019t listen to anything she said, and she wrote Something to Say about how annoyed this made her feel.\nShe posted this song online, and it became a huge success. She was delighted when people left comments saying that they loved it and found new meanings in the words each time they heard them. Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from his office on the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first she wasn\u2019t sure; she didn\u2019t know anything about the company, and didn\u2019t want someone telling her what to sing. However, Joss persuaded her this wouldn\u2019t happen, and a short time later she performed at a concert in Dublin arranged by Isotope. They sold all the tickets very quickly and it was an amazing evening.\nAna says she\u2019s less interested in writing songs about when life\u2019s good; when it\u2019s not, there\u2019s more for her to say. One of her favourite songs is Decision, written about why her brother stopped singing for a while, and how unhappy it made him.

{"id": 65, "title": "My Canadian trip\nby Louise Walton", "text": "Last year I went on an amazing trip \u2013 travelling by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry\u2019s idea. He\u2019s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He\u2019s also a great fan of boats, although that\u2019s one interest we definitely don\u2019t share. But I\u2019d dreamt of visiting the area ever since seeing it on TV as a child, especially as I knew it was where our great-grandparents had lived before moving to Europe. So I kept asking Harry if I could go too \u2013 until he finally agreed!\nA few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily the forecast for the time we intended to be there was for calm seas. Although there was plenty to arrange, I was busy at work so didn\u2019t have much time to think about what needed doing. But Harry promised he\u2019d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.\nAfter arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats and set off. The guide had mentioned that very few people now lived along that coast, and sure enough, the only other living creatures we saw on that first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see very far, so I just focussed on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. \nWe often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish, many of which I didn\u2019t recognise. And it was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it really felt like stress-free living!\nWhen the time came to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I\u2019d miss family and friends.

{"id": 66, "title": "Basketball player\nLuka Horvat writes about his early career.", "text": "My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, as his father had been before him, and I went to watch many of his games when I was a kid. You might think that seeing so many matches would give me a love of the sport, but it actually had the opposite effect. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, of course, especially when he won a game, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching.\nStarting secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager but was already two metres tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I\u2019d be interested in training with the basketball team. Even though I enjoyed the session, I thought I\u2019d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match, but the teacher had more confidence in me than I did. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. Mum and Dad coming to watch didn\u2019t really help \u2013 it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end!   \nFor the next four years, I practised every day and did really well, even joining an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was fantastic to work with him. However, I can\u2019t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents.

{"id": 67, "title": "Robert Allen \u2013 tour guide", "text": "Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but needed to find a part-time job as my course was rather expensive. After considering several options, I trained to become a weekend tour guide in my home city \u2013 Chicago, USA. This involved taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised to discover how much I enjoyed giving those tours. I got to see the city that I\u2019d been living in my whole life through the eyes of tourists, and it felt like a new experience every time!\nAfter finishing my studies I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. Although I thought it would be quite simple, in fact when I researched what I had to do, I found out that to get a licence as a full-time tour guide I needed to know a lot more than I\u2019d learnt so far. All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city, covering everything from local architecture and history to the rules of public transport. After several challenging but interesting months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide.\nTour guiding isn\u2019t just about knowing historical facts or making sure you don\u2019t lose anyone from your group in the crowds. There are many other necessary skills. You should be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations, for example, if a place that you thought was open is actually closed when you arrive, or a route changes. Tourists don\u2019t want to hear what the problems are or that they\u2019re missing out on something, they just want to enjoy a well-organised tour. \nI need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That\u2019s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job means that my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago.", "level": "B1", "diff": 58.192, "fac": 0.6456, "questions": {"1": {"text": "Why did Robert decide to start working as a weekend tour guide?", "answer": "c", "diff": 46.95, "disc": 0.274, "fac": 0.843, "options": {"a": {"text": "to have more fun in his life", "disc": -0.15, "fac": 0.01}, "b": {"text": "to see his city in the same way tourists did", "disc": -0.03, "fac": 0.07}, "c": {"text": "to help pay for his studies", "disc": 0.27, "fac": 0.84}, "d": {"text": "to show visitors how wonderful his city is", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.07}}}, "2": {"text": "What does Robert say about becoming a full-time tour guide?", "answer": "b", "diff": 55.4, "disc": 0.507, "fac": 0.711, "options": {"a": {"text": "He already had all the knowledge he required.", "disc": -0.29, "fac": 0.07}, "b": {"text": "He was surprised to discover what was involved.", "disc": 0.51, "fac": 0.71}, "c": {"text": "He was afraid some tourists\u2019 questions might be too difficult.", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.13}, "d": {"text": "He found it quite easy to get a licence.", "disc": -0.33, "fac": 0.08}}}, "3": {"text": "What does Robert feel is the most important part of his job?", "answer": "d", "diff": 60.32, "disc": 0.507, "fac": 0.614, "options": {"a": {"text": "checking that nobody gets lost during the tour", "disc": -0.2, "fac": 0.07}, "b": {"text": "solving the tourists\u2019 problems", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.06}, "c": {"text": "giving tourists all the details of any changes", "disc": -0.33, "fac": 0.24}, "d": {"text": "dealing with unexpected events during a tour", "disc": 0.51, "fac": 0.61}}}, "4": {"text": "What does Robert say about the reviews he receives?", "answer": "a", "diff": 72.89, "disc": 0.506, "fac": 0.349, "options": {"a": {"text": "It\u2019s wise to take them seriously.", "disc": 0.51, "fac": 0.35}, "b": {"text": "His customers always enjoy reading them.", "disc": -0.41, "fac": 0.22}, "c": {"text": "They show his tours are the most popular in Chicago.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.18}, "d": {"text": "They help him plan better tours for future visitors.", "disc": 0.02, "fac": 0.24}}}, "5": {"text": "What would be a good introduction to this text?", "answer": "c", "diff": 55.4, "disc": 0.101, "fac": 0.711, "options": {"a": {"text": "Robert Allen tells us about what he did to achieve his childhood ambition.

{"id": 68, "title": "Being a volunteer in Thailand\n", "text": "My name\u2019s Ella and I\u2019m 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Despite being five years younger than me, our relationship isn\u2019t too bad. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary \u2013 a place where people look after sick and rescued elephants. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure at first if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was the first time we\u2019d done anything like that before. In the end, though, there was no need to worry.\nOne of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect the elephants\u2019 food. Elephants eat huge amounts of grass and banana plants, so collecting this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard work, but to see the elephants enjoying their meal meant that, for me, it was worth it. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found that so much fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants did! The part of the day I most looked forward to was the evening. By the light of the moon we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night.\nAll the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn\u2019t have much space. That was our decision, though, as Josie didn\u2019t want to be on her own.  It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we\u2019d expected that. The meals were delicious \u2013 and didn\u2019t include meat, which neither of us is keen on. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.\nNow that we\u2019re back in the UK, Josie doesn\u2019t often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s being completely honest. I think she\u2019s probably a bit annoyed with herself now that she didn\u2019t take full advantage of her time there because she was missing her friends too much.

We don\u2019t just sell flowers to people buying them for friends or for their homes; all kinds of customers want flowers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in Reception, and sometimes we take part in photo sessions for businesses by providing flowers for their advertising pictures. Once I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It took a huge amount of work but I was really proud of the job we\u2019d done. \nMy day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then and my friends think I must be crazy, but it\u2019s never bothered me \u2013 I\u2019m excited about what I do. It\u2019s often colder than I\u2019d like, and it\u2019s usually dark, but you can\u2019t expect anything else at that time in the morning, so I don\u2019t let it worry me. \nThe flower market\u2019s wonderful, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make decision-making challenging. If I was choosing for myself, I\u2019d probably only get pink ones \u2013 it\u2019s my favourite colour.

I\u2019m not so keen on having to argue about prices with the flower-sellers but it\u2019s a necessary part of the job. Flowers aren\u2019t cheap, so I have to try to get the best price possible.\nBack at the shop we look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I\u2019ve bought. Then we get on with creating bunches of flowers and working out how much orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they\u2019d like. Some people might think this sounds like too much trouble, but I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend.

It\u2019s around the corner from where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing \u2013 the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club! \nWe decided early on that we didn\u2019t want to hire a cinema to show the films in. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we hired an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was freezing cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which means we can keep our prices low. We\u2019re happy to make enough to cover our costs \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to make a profit.\nEach time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us, especially now we\u2019ve got our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we\u2019ve sold because everything\u2019s online \u2013 no more concerns about empty seats! There\u2019s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they\u2019ve had, it\u2019s wonderful. \nThe website\u2019s been a great help, and we\u2019re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We\u2019ve been to see how people do things in different places \u2013 but it\u2019s always good to get back to our own club again! We\u2019ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We\u2019ve also tried putting up a few posters in caf\u00e9s.  Nothing\u2019s as successful as word of mouth, though \u2013 people recommending us to their friends.

{"id": 71, "title": "Martin Cabello \u2013 young photographer", "text": "Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. And when I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. Actually, many other young photographers before me had done the same thing, but it seemed like a really great idea to me, and so I started.\nAfter a few weeks I decided to put these photos onto a website for young photographers because I was keen to create a photo diary, and also to have the chance to show other people my photos. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better \u2013 and I agreed.\nSo I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was very different to what many other young photographers were doing \u2013 they were all taking colour photos. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices.\nOne day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I\u2019ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me.

In the NYC you can do different activities to challenge yourself and you\u2019re always learning something. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called \u2018leaders\u2019. When you complete each level you get a certificate.\nWhen I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children\u2019s club for two hours a week. I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea; I\u2019d joined that same club when I was eight and I\u2019d found it really difficult to make friends. I was quite shy then and all the other children already had their own friendship groups, so I\u2019d stopped going after a couple of weeks. I decided to take up the challenge though, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate.\nSoon, however, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children\u2019s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I\u2019d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I\u2019m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.\nBecause of what I\u2019ve learnt at the children\u2019s club, I\u2019ve decided that when I finish school in three years\u2019 time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker \u2013 someone who works with children. It wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever considered before starting at the club. In fact, I\u2019d never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind.

The hill looked unbelievably steep so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. Because I was so young, I hadn\u2019t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too \u2013 he made it look so simple. And in the end, I managed just fine. \nAfter this experience, it wasn\u2019t long before I\u2019d developed a love of the sport and had improved my ability too. I started competing aged ten. Some people enter loads of competitions, and end up getting bored of snowboarding, but my love of taking part, and winning too, if I\u2019m honest, has got stronger as I\u2019ve got older, which always helps me to push myself harder. I enjoy not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this goes well, like when I became the first female ever to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d even attempt the jumps that got me this score until I actually set off. That achievement increased my trust in my own abilities.\nDuring the summer, I focus on training and my studies while there\u2019s no snow. Although I train daily, it\u2019s nice not having to stick to quite a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also get to spend lots of time with my friends then. It\u2019s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much and what I\u2019m really good at. \nI have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it\u2019s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don\u2019t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I\u2019m wondering whether becoming a doctor is a possibility, if my active life allows time for doing a college degree.

One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday and, of course, I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that \u2013 it taught me a really valuable lesson.\nI worked every Saturday in a caf\u00e9, but I didn\u2019t really enjoy it, so my parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I\u2019d seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could have a go at that. I\u2019d never imagined I\u2019d find it so easy, as it had seemed so complicated when I\u2019d watched Mum doing it. My friends thought it sounded dull, but I was really into the idea. Mum had shown me it was possible to create something attractive at home using basic tools and materials.\nI sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I\u2019d finished making them.

They thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall!

Being Amelia is partly based on Janine\u2019s life. In one interview about her book, Janine said, \u2018Because of my father\u2019s job, my family\u2019s moved around the country a lot, so I\u2019ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it\u2019s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book focus on Amelia\u2019s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother. As I\u2019m my parents\u2019 only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.\u2019\nJanine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she\u2019d entered a short story competition on a young writers\u2019 website and won first prize. That\u2019s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine\u2019s novel was on sale in bookshops.\nOne review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges, and this is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn\u2019t a particularly long novel, she\u2019s clearly shown that she\u2019s a better writer than several other best selling authors.\nJanine\u2019s still getting used to being a famous writer: \u2018At first, I hid when people recognised me in the street, but now it\u2019s OK. Although I\u2019d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them.

We were just focused on what life on the island would be like \u2013 we knew the castle probably wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable as our cosy home just across the water, and there was no school.\nOnce we\u2019d moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn\u2019t particularly beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in summer as it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren\u2019t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other, though, and help with repairs on the island, which often involves lots of hard work.\nThe biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves \u2013 but the ferries don\u2019t run then! And I\u2019ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I\u2019m always telling them to hurry up!\nBut we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it\u2019s so foggy that you can\u2019t see a thing, then within hours it\u2019s brilliant sunshine again \u2013 it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get awful storms, and I wonder sometimes if the castle\u2019s strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it\u2019s been here for centuries \u2013 and it\u2019s still standing!", "level": "B1", "diff": 58.198, "fac": 0.5624, "questions": {"1": {"text": "When Tom\u2019s father was offered the job at the castle, his family", "answer": "b", "diff": 60.94, "disc": 0.516, "fac": 0.505, "options": {"a": {"text": "were delighted that he was going to be promoted.", "disc": -0.28, "fac": 0.14}, "b": {"text": "needed time to decide whether it was a good idea.", "disc": 0.52, "fac": 0.5}, "c": {"text": "didn\u2019t mind leaving their family home.", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.15}, "d": {"text": "didn\u2019t realise what an unusual opportunity it was for him.", "disc": -0.2, "fac": 0.2}}}, "2": {"text": "What does Tom say about living on the island in the second paragraph?", "answer": "a", "diff": 54.33, "disc": 0.666, "fac": 0.644, "options": {"a": {"text": "He\u2019s disappointed there are so few people his age.", "disc": 0.67, "fac": 0.64}, "b": {"text": "He\u2019s enjoying helping others when they need it.", "disc": -0.4, "fac": 0.15}, "c": {"text": "He\u2019s less keen on the castle now than before they moved.", "disc": -0.31, "fac": 0.14}, "d": {"text": "He\u2019s used to meeting new people all through the year.", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.05}}}, "3": {"text": "Tom feels that travelling to and from school by boat", "answer": "d", "diff": 54.33, "disc": 0.329, "fac": 0.644, "options": {"a": {"text": "is the most exciting part of his day.", "disc": -0.28, "fac": 0.13}, "b": {"text": "means he can\u2019t invite friends back after school.", "disc": -0.24, "fac": 0.03}, "c": {"text": "is still enjoyable even when the weather is bad.", "disc": -0.05, "fac": 0.2}, "d": {"text": "makes him stressed about getting home.", "disc": 0.33, "fac": 0.64}}}, "4": {"text": "How does Tom feel about the views from the castle?", "answer": "c", "diff": 72.9, "disc": 0.156, "fac": 0.267, "options": {"a": {"text": "He\u2019s especially amazed at the evening sunsets.", "disc": 0.13, "fac": 0.55}, "b": {"text": "He\u2019s sad when he sometimes can\u2019t see very far.", "disc": -0.09, "fac": 0.05}, "c": {"text": "He\u2019s impressed at how the weather changes so quickly.", "disc": 0.16, "fac": 0.27}, "d": {"text": "He\u2019s worried when he sees storms damaging the castle.", "disc": -0.27, "fac": 0.11}}}, "5": {"text": "What would be a suitable title for this article?", "answer": "b", "diff": 48.49, "disc": 0.535, "fac": 0.752, "options": {"a": {"text": "How we prepared for life in a castle", "disc": -0.24, "fac": 0.12}, "b": {"text": "Living on an island \u2013 the good and the not so good!", "disc": 0.53, "fac": 0.75}, "c": {"text": "A dream that finally came true", "disc": -0.39, "fac": 0.07}, "d": {"text": "Do you want an easier life?

I\u2019ve always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby \u2013 birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home I joined a local young birdwatchers\u2019 club. \nMy goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I\u2019ve almost achieved that, because on family holidays abroad I\u2019ve had the opportunity to see birds from other countries, too. We always look for places where there are group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I\u2019ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I\u2019d have a good chance to see my 200th species. I wasn\u2019t too disappointed when it didn\u2019t happen, though, as I\u2019ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby.\nI posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it and commented that it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching to the school. I didn\u2019t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I\u2019d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over and the teachers said I\u2019d prepared well and they\u2019d really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year!\nI\u2019m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places which have lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby.

{"id": 78, "title": "Football and me!\n16-year-old Alicia Hughes looks back at how she started out in football.", "text": "I started playing football when I was 7. I\u2019d rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after a while, I wasn\u2019t a bad player. However, my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so I\u2019m sure they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did.\nIn fact, I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I\u2019d hoped. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women\u2019s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I didn\u2019t believe it at first \u2013 I had no idea that young girls could join women\u2019s clubs.  But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old.\nAfter that, I improved enormously. Despite this, people still weren\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But the coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself \u2013 he even let me play in one of the club\u2019s championship matches, much earlier than I\u2019d expected! I\u2019ve never run so hard in my life \u2013 I didn\u2019t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then by pure luck, I got the winning goal. As usual, in spite of the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach\u2019s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me round the pitch. Fantastic! \nSince then, I\u2019ve scored lots more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are running a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football, and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club. It\u2019ll let them see the professional environment, and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team, if they\u2019re prepared to put in the work. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me \u2013 you\u2019ll have good times, but be prepared for bad times too.

The man at the Greek port seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I\u2019d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although obviously still puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile.\nOur group had exchanged emails before we set off, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim.

I\u2019d trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not at all where I\u2019d hoped. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own.\nThe following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery.

Before the interview, I\u2019d practised what to say \u2013 more than simply that I loved to travel, as everyone else would say the same. Instead, I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience \u2013 and I got the job! \nI\u2019d recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile \u2013 but the free flights I get aren\u2019t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there\u2019s a saying \u2013 \u2018no-one\u2019s finished till everyone\u2019s finished.\u2019 It\u2019s like a big family \u2013 even though we don\u2019t see each other all the time, we\u2019re still close.\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I don\u2019t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I\u2019ll probably never see them again!", "level": "B1", "diff": 64.914, "fac": 0.4764, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What is Jack trying to do in the text about being a flight attendant?", "answer": "c", "diff": 63.38, "disc": 0.243, "fac": 0.513, "options": {"a": {"text": "prove that it is more challenging than people think", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "describe the different duties involved in the job", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "suggest other young people consider it as a career", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "explain why it wasn\u2019t his first career choice", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "2": {"text": "Jack thinks he became interested in the job because", "answer": "d", "diff": 72.7, "disc": 0.225, "fac": 0.3, "options": {"a": {"text": "he knew he was the right kind of person to do it.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "he admired the airline staff he\u2019d had contact with.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "he had enjoyed travelling by plane as a child.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "he had already experienced what the work involved.", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "3": {"text": "What does Jack say about attending his job interview?", "answer": "b", "diff": 70.91, "disc": 0.357, "fac": 0.338, "options": {"a": {"text": "He was surprised at the age range of people there.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "He made sure he seemed different from the others.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "He wondered whether he had enough qualifications.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "He realised there were too many people for the jobs available.", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "4": {"text": "How does Jack feel about the staff he works with?", "answer": "a", "diff": 53.94, "disc": 0.38, "fac": 0.725, "options": {"a": {"text": "happy with the way everyone supports each other", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "amazed they remember him after only a brief meeting", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "sorry that he doesn\u2019t get to spend longer with them", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "disappointed that some don\u2019t work as hard as they should", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "5": {"text": "What might Jack write in an email to a friend at home?", "answer": "c", "diff": 63.64, "disc": 0.255, "fac": 0.506, "options": {"a": {"text": "Even though I work for an airline, I have to pay for all my own holiday flights until I\u2019ve been here a bit longer.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "We had some really difficult passengers to deal with on board today.

{"id": 119, "title": "My Job at a Summer Camp, by Charlie Rose", "text": "At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do.  Nearly all the children know how to swim and play table-tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them.  Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end.  This makes them feel great.\nWe do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week.  It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most \u2013 it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds.  We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time.  First we tell them they can phone home after lunch.  Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow.  Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.\nIt's not always the children who feel lonely.  We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is getting on, which is quite unnecessary.  Often their son or daughter will be busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to ring back another time.\nWe often get a certain type of child coming, typically dressed in expensive  new clothes.  Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but before long they understand the reason why.

{"id": 120, "title": "Rock the Planet\nMusic journalist Nick Hilman meets young actors from this popular musical show.", "text": "Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be really good musicians, opened in London last year, after five years in the USA, where it was voted \u2018Best Musical\u2019 four times! But doing the show with an all-British cast of actors was challenging. The UK puts more limits on how many performances young actors can do weekly \u2013 in the USA, they\u2019re allowed to do more shows. Because of this, twice as many actors were required here. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors, and they\u2019ve just won their first \u2018Best Musical\u2019 award.  Although the theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, it\u2019s been full every night, with everyone wanting to hear the songs that first became popular in America. \nI met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show\u2019s actors. \u2018It\u2019s brilliant that I get paid to play,\u2019 he said, \u2018especially a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.\u2019 He told me how busy the young actors are. \u2018We have normal school lessons each day at the theatre. While the teacher\u2019s great, I miss my old school mates.\u2019 And what do they think of the show? \u2018Well, my whole class came! The theatre does special deals on tickets for schools. They absolutely loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it\u2019s expensive for them,\u2019 he explained. \nWhen I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play along with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I wasn\u2019t familiar with. Jamie took me through it and I was very pleased with myself when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie\u2019s ability and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show\u2019s director wasn\u2019t there to hear my mistakes! \nWhile the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they\u2019ve found it pretty easy. Jamie admitted that the hard part was appearing natural when they first performed together.
