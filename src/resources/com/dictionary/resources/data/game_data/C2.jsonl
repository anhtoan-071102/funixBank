{"id": 1, "title": "Blogging: Confessing to the world", "text": "Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins \u2013 online announcements of your whereabouts. The site\u2019s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m at this place\u2019 \u2013 but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere \u2013 not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous \u2013 and we are lost. \nDepressing? Perhaps, but don\u2019t give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity\u2019s temptations and perils \u2013 all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it\u2019s worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. \nIn January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the \u2018WWW\u2019, as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at Cern, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once.\nHall\u2019s ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall\u2019s site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he\u2019d fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told \u2018either the blog goes, or I do\u2019. He\u2019d published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, \u2018it makes people not trust me\u2019. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to \u2018make people want to be with you\u2019, you\u2019ll be disappointed. \nIn 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong\u2019s blog to every vice president at her company \u2013 including some whom she\u2019d mocked \u2013 and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the \u2018online distribution effect\u2019: that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we\u2019d never dream of saying in person. But the web isn\u2019t some king of alternative reality where we can let our hair down without worrying about repercussions. Our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes.\nArmstrong\u2019s saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of \u2018mommy bloggers\u2019 and her writing supports her household. Once a poster-child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should.", "level": "C2", "diff": 78.06375, "fac": 0.637, "questions": {"1": {"text": "Why does the writer describe a website about public check-ins in the first paragraph?", "answer": "a", "diff": 83.03, "disc": 0.397, "fac": 0.548, "options": {"a": {"text": "to reinforce the concerns already felt by some people", "disc": 0.4, "fac": 0.55}, "b": {"text": "to remind readers to beware of false promises", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.08}, "c": {"text": "to explain that such sites often have a hidden agenda", "disc": -0.22, "fac": 0.26}, "d": {"text": "to show that the risks of internet use are sometimes over estimated", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.11}}}, "2": {"text": "Which phrase echoes the image introduced in the phrase \u2018This future has a map\u2019 (line 10)?

They can be a bit arrogant sometimes, but not even the most gung-ho physicist would claim to possess all the keys to the cosmos. Even so, some felt moved to issue public warnings about the film, describing it in terms ranging from the peremptory (\u2018atrocious\u2019) through to the darkly disturbing (\u2018It is a very dangerous piece of work\u2019). Clearly, this was a must-see movie. Yet, for the first twenty minutes or so, I couldn\u2019t see what all the fuss was about. Various scientists made pretty innocuous statements about how new discoveries were revealing the universe to be far stranger than anyone had expected.\nIt was when the film moved on to describe some of these discoveries that I did, at last, begin to see what the fuss was really about \u2013 discoveries like the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. I had heard rumours before of how a Japanese researcher had shown that the very shape of a water molecule could be radically altered just by the thoughts of those around it. Yet when the movie described this astonishing discovery, all it gave by way of evidence was some pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and nasty after being exposed to someone in a bad mood.  \nNow, lots of people do find this kind of evidence pretty compelling. It\u2019s immediate, clear, and apt to prompt wide smiles and uncritical sentiments from the ill-informed, like \u2018Hey, man, far out\u2019. Among scientists, though, the typical response has been: \u2018Give me a break\u2019. I know what they mean. Sure, the idea that water is affected by thoughts is an amazing claim with huge implications. With no obvious explanation, it also raises the possibility of radical new forces at work in the cosmos. But before we get too carried away, it might be an idea to have some decent proof that the effect is real. And pretty photos of crystals, nice as they undoubtedly are, just don\u2019t cut it. \nThe real problem is that the movie\u2019s claims weren\u2019t bizarre enough. Try this: water molecules owe their properties to a form of energy that appears literally out of nowhere, which appears to be linked to a force now propelling the expansion of the whole universe. And the evidence is more than just a few pretty pictures; it comes from decades of research in laboratories and observatories around the world. The truth is that discoveries are now being made which prove beyond doubt that \u2013 just as the film claims \u2013 the universe is far stranger than anyone could have believed. Astronomers have found that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter, and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as \u2018dark energy\u2019. \nThe movie aside, discoveries being made on a more down to earth level are no less astounding. Neuroscientists have found evidence that our conscious perception of events lags behind reality by around half a second \u2013 a delay we fail to notice because it is deliberately edited out by our brains. Anthropologists now believe they have identified the birthplace of modern humans, and how \u2013 and why \u2013 they left it to populate the world. And, completing the cosmic circle, some theorists claim to have found links between the existence of life \u2013 including ours \u2013 on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe. \nDespite what some might have us believe, science shows no signs of reaching completion. On the contrary, we appear to be further away from omniscience than ever. It is now clear that many, if not most, natural phenomena can never be understood to the level once believed possible. The emergence of the concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have put unavoidable bounds on what we can know. This has culminated in the efforts of some of the world\u2019s leading theoretical physicists to create the so-called Theory of Everything, which will sum up all the forces and particles of the universe in a single equation.

If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.  The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.  The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves, which are sometimes dyed a brilliant gold.  Meanwhile, in the garden, buds appear on flowers, and colourful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the subtle transition from one season to the next.\nSince the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories.  My pattern has been this: once I finish a novel, I find I want to write some short stories; once a group of short stories is done, then I feel like focusing on a novel.  I never write any short stories while I\u2019m writing a novel, and never write a novel while I\u2019m working on short stories.  The two types of writing may very well engage different parts of the brain, and it takes some time to get off one track and switch to the other.\nIt was only after I began my career with two short novels in 1975 that I started, from 1984 to 1985, to write short stories.  I knew little about short-story writing then so it was rough going, but I did find the experience really memorable.  I felt the possibilities of my fictional world expand by several degrees.  And readers seemed to appreciate this other side of me as a writer.  One of my earliest works, \u2018Breaking Waves\u2019, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.  This was my starting point as a short-story writer.\nOne of the joys of writing short stories is that they don\u2019t take so long to finish.  Generally it takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape (though revisions can be endless).  It\u2019s not like the total physical and mental commitment you have to make for the year or two it takes to compose a novel.  You go into a room, finish your work, and leave.  That\u2019s it.  For me, at least, writing a novel can seem to drag on for ever, and I sometimes wonder if I\u2019m going to survive.  So I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace.\nOne more nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story out of the smallest things \u2013 an idea that springs up in your mind, a word, an image, whatever.  In most cases it\u2019s like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to.  And another good point is that with short stories you don\u2019t have to worry about failing.  If the idea doesn\u2019t work out the way you hoped it would, you just shrug your shoulders and tell yourself that they can\u2019t all be winners.  Even with masters of the genre like the American writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver, not every short story is a masterpiece.  I find this a great comfort.  You can learn from your mistakes (in other words, those you cannot call a complete success) and use that in the next story you write.  In my case, when I write novels I try very hard to learn from the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories.  In that sense the short story is a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist.  It is hard to experiment the way I like to do inside the framework of a novel, so without short stories I know I would find the task of writing novels even more difficult and demanding.\nMy short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind.  I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did.  Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.", "level": "C2", "diff": 75.95833333, "fac": 0.666666667, "questions": {"1": {"text": "The writer uses the metaphor of a forest and a garden ", "answer": "a", "diff": 68.84, "disc": 0.419, "fac": 0.846, "options": {"a": {"text": "to suggest that his novels and short stories are parts of a whole.", "disc": 0.42, "fac": 0.85}, "b": {"text": "to point out the need to read novels and short stories in different ways.", "disc": -0.15, "fac": 0.04}, "c": {"text": "to highlight the difficulty of trying to differentiate between his novels and short stories.", "disc": -0.22, "fac": 0.05}, "d": {"text": "to emphasise the fact that writing novels and short stories comes naturally to him.", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.06}}}, "2": {"text": "What does the writer suggest about alternating between writing novels and short stories in the second paragraph?", "answer": "a", "diff": 79.0, "disc": 0.25, "fac": 0.5, "options": {"a": {"text": "The process of adjustment demands some effort.", "disc": 0.05, "fac": 0.55}, "b": {"text": "It reveals his tendency to be easily distracted.", "disc": 0.1, "fac": 0.01}, "c": {"text": "Changing this arrangement would be impractical.", "disc": 0.16, "fac": 0.15}, "d": {"text": "It involves complex mental processes.", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.28}}}, "3": {"text": "What does the writer say about his first short stories?", "answer": "c", "diff": 73.02, "disc": 0.268, "fac": 0.782, "options": {"a": {"text": "His relative inexperience showed in them.", "disc": 0.0, "fac": 0.0}, "b": {"text": "His readers were pleasantly surprised by them.", "disc": -0.31, "fac": 0.19}, "c": {"text": "They opened up new creative opportunities.", "disc": 0.27, "fac": 0.78}, "d": {"text": "Writing them was trickier than he had expected.", "disc": 0.08, "fac": 0.03}}}, "4": {"text": "What does the writer suggest about writing novels in the fourth paragraph?", "answer": "d", "diff": 78.84, "disc": 0.244, "fac": 0.667, "options": {"a": {"text": "They are harder to rework than short stories.

It has eased our lives and threatened our existence. It aspires, but in some very basic way fails, to understand the ant and the origins of the universe, the infinitesimal atom and the mind-bludgeoning immensity of the cosmos. It has laid its hand on the shoulders of poets and politicians, philosophers and charlatans. Its beauty is often apparent only to the initiated, its perils are generally misunderstood, its importance has been both over and underestimated, and its fallibility, and that of those who create it, is often glossed over or malevolently exaggerated.\nThe attempt to explain the physical universe has been characterized by perpetual conflict. Established theories have continually been modified or violently overthrown, and as in the history of music, innovations tend to be ridiculed only to become, in time, the new dogma. The struggle between old and new has rarely been dignified. Scientists come in many colors, of which the green of jealousy and the purple of rage are fashionable shades. The essence of scientific history has been conflict.\nThis book presents science as a series of ideas that changed the course not only of science itself but often of whole areas of human thought. Science, of course, has its practical benefits, but they will not be our primary concern. This is not a book about non-stick frying pans. We will be looking at ideas \u2013 admiring their beauty, occasionally standing awestruck before the towers of imagination, but always being prepared to doubt; always being aware not only of the ingenuity but also of the deep limitations, and the repeatedly demonstrable inertia, of the human mind.\nScience, by its nature, is changeable. There is always some scientist, somewhere, who is disproving an explanation that another scientist has proposed. Usually these shifts of interpretation leave the fabric of society undisturbed. Occasionally, however, real revolutions tear down part of our system of established beliefs. Thus, in the seventeenth century, science presented us with a mechanical universe, a giant inexorable clock. Three centuries later, physics has questioned some basic assumptions, leading us into a shadowy maze where we affect the universe by the act of observing it and are ignorant of the true meaning of our most basic concepts.\nSome see the fragility of scientific theory as an indication of a basic inability of science to explain the universe. But scientific change is almost always accompanied by an increase in our ability to rationalize and predict the course of nature. The seventeenth-century English scientist Isaac Newton could explain far more than the Ancient Greek polymath Aristotle, and Albert Einstein, the father of modern physics, more than Newton. Science frequently stumbles, but it gets up and carries on. The road is long. It is prudent to recall that at the end of the nineteenth century the general opinion amongst physicists was that nothing of any great import remained to be done in physics. And then came radioactivity, X-rays, the discovery of the electron and the nucleus, a couple of hundred new fundamental particles, quantum mechanics and relativity, antimatter, dark matter, black holes, chaos, the Big Bang, and so on. Biology has been no less prolific. At present, there are again voices proclaiming the imminent arrival of a theory of everything, a complete explanation of the origins of the universe and workings of the cosmos. Maybe.\nScience is not a harmless intellectual pastime. In the last two centuries we have moved from being simply observers of nature to being, in a modest but growing way, its controllers. Concomitantly, we have occasionally disturbed the balance of nature in ways that we did not always understand. Science has to be watched. Non-scientists can no longer afford to stand to one side, ignorant of the meaning of advances that will determine the kind of world that their children will inhabit \u2013 and the kind of children that they will have. Science has become part of the human race\u2019s way of conceiving of and manipulating its future. The manipulation of the future is not a question to be left to  philosophers. The answers can affect the national budget, the health of your next child \u2013 even the long-term prospects for life on this planet.", "level": "C2", "diff": 69.74428571, "fac": 0.769428571, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What is the writer\u2019s main purpose in the first paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 71.39, "disc": 0.412, "fac": 0.759, "options": {"a": {"text": "to defend science against its detractors", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.05}, "b": {"text": "to emphasise the practical benefits of science", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.06}, "c": {"text": "to outline the inherent contradictions of scientific enquiry", "disc": 0.41, "fac": 0.76}, "d": {"text": "to call for a more interdisciplinary approach to science", "disc": -0.25, "fac": 0.13}}}, "2": {"text": "The writer refers to music and science to make the point that in both disciplines  ", "answer": "a", "diff": 72.04, "disc": 0.296, "fac": 0.747, "options": {"a": {"text": "new ideas are rarely accepted immediately.", "disc": 0.3, "fac": 0.75}, "b": {"text": "respect for traditional practices has been lost.", "disc": -0.04, "fac": 0.01}, "c": {"text": "there is intense rivalry among practitioners.", "disc": 0.1, "fac": 0.02}, "d": {"text": "controversies are essential for progress.", "disc": -0.34, "fac": 0.22}}}, "3": {"text": "In the third paragraph, the writer says that when appreciating the beauty of scientific ideas, it is important to", "answer": "a", "diff": 71.39, "disc": 0.522, "fac": 0.759, "options": {"a": {"text": "maintain a critical perspective.", "disc": 0.52, "fac": 0.76}, "b": {"text": "reflect on their wider significance.", "disc": -0.47, "fac": 0.18}, "c": {"text": "disregard their real-life application.", "disc": -0.15, "fac": 0.05}, "d": {"text": "put each one in its historical context.", "disc": -0.08, "fac": 0.01}}}, "4": {"text": "What does the writer suggest about science in the fourth paragraph?", "answer": "b", "diff": 72.69, "disc": 0.529, "fac": 0.735, "options": {"a": {"text": "Its practitioners are reluctant to collaborate on research projects.", "disc": -0.36, "fac": 0.06}, "b": {"text": "There is less certainty about it than in some previous eras.", "disc": 0.53, "fac": 0.73}, "c": {"text": "Its practitioners are unwilling to tackle deeper questions about the universe.", "disc": -0.29, "fac": 0.08}, "d": {"text": "There is a reduced role for it in today\u2019s society.", "disc": -0.15, "fac": 0.11}}}, "5": {"text": "What does the writer say about scientific enquiry in the fifth paragraph?", "answer": "d", "diff": 72.04, "disc": 0.113, "fac": 0.747, "options": {"a": {"text": "It has repeatedly proven sceptics wrong.", "disc": 0.0, "fac": 0.19}, "b": {"text": "Its weaknesses have led to a loss of faith in scientists.", "disc": -0.24, "fac": 0.05}, "c": {"text": "Its proponents have been accused of arrogance.", "disc": 0.03, "fac": 0.01}, "d": {"text": "It is still capable of yielding important insights.", "disc": 0.11, "fac": 0.75}}}, "6": {"text": "What is the writer suggesting with the word \u2018maybe\u2019 in line 36?", "answer": "c", "diff": 53.55, "disc": 0.097, "fac": 0.952, "options": {"a": {"text": "In future we may make fewer significant discoveries in biology than in physics.", "disc": 0.02, "fac": 0.02}, "b": {"text": "It may be unwise for humans to attempt to control natural processes.", "disc": 0.0, "fac": 0.0}, "c": {"text": "We may never find the answers to some fundamental questions.", "disc": 0.1, "fac": 0.95}, "d": {"text": "Recent developments in physics may have dangerous implications for humanity.", "disc": -0.16, "fac": 0.02}}}, "7": {"text": "The writer argues that non-specialists need to ", "answer": "b", "diff": 75.11, "disc": 0.109, "fac": 0.687, "options": {"a": {"text": "recognise that investment in science is a priority.", "disc": -0.1, "fac": 0.05}, "b": {"text": "take responsibility for increasing their knowledge of science.", "disc": 0.11, "fac": 0.69}, "c": {"text": "be more tolerant of scientific errors.", "disc": 0.12, "fac": 0.02}, "d": {"text": "support scientists in preserving our existence on Earth.", "disc": -0.11, "fac": 0.24}}}}}/n{"id": 5, "title": "The myth of the disappearing book\nBooks have endured many technical revolutions. So when faced with the transformative power of technology, is the problem often our aversion to change?", "text": "From around 2015, after years of sales growth, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had flattened out, or even fallen in some cases, introducing new doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive even admitted recently that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with his company losing too much confidence in \u2018the power of the word on the page\u2019. Yet despite the obvious conclusion that digital and print can easily coexist in the market, the question of whether the ebook will \u2018kill\u2019 the print book still continues to surface. It doesn\u2019t matter if the intention is to predict or dismiss this possibility; what is significant is the fact that the potential disappearance of the book does not cease to stimulate our imagination or provoke intense debate.\nWhy is this idea so powerful? Why do we frame the encounter between ebooks and print books in terms of a struggle, even if all the evidence is to the contrary? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and tell us much more about the mixture of exhilaration and fear we feel about innovation and change in general. In my research, I have discussed how the idea of one medium \u2018killing\u2019 another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. After television was invented, for instance, many claimed radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses; people started listening in cars, during train rides and on factory floors.\nEven the idea of the disappearing book isn\u2019t new, either. As early as 1894, there was speculation that the introduction of the phonograph would spell the demise of books: They\u2019d be replaced by what we today call audiobooks. This sort of thing has happened time after time. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks and smartphones \u2013 all, at one time or another, have apparently conspired to destroy print books as a source of culture and entertainment. Some claimed the end of books would result in cultural regression and decline. Others, envisioning utopian digital futures, overstated the advantages of ebooks. It is not by chance then that the idea of the death of the book surfaces in moments of technological change. This narrative, in fact, perfectly conveys the mixture of hopes and fears that characterises our deepest reactions to technological change.\nTo understand why these reactions are so common, one has to consider that we create emotional bonds with different media as they become a core part of our life. Numerous studies have shown how we develop a close connection with objects such as books, televisions and computers, even to the extent of giving a name to our car or shouting at our laptop for not working properly. Consequently, the emergence of a new technology \u2013 like e-readers \u2013 doesn\u2019t just indicate economic and social change. It also causes us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life.\nAs a result, as technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. And it\u2019s why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies. The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, for example, made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened in the shift from analog to digital photography, and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of \u2018old\u2019 books \u2013 and even for their often unpleasant smell. This should provide some reassurance to those who still worry about the disappearance of print books.\nYet the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide an appealing narrative about both the transformative power of technology and our aversion to change. In fact, one of the strategies we employ in order to make sense of change is the use of narrative patterns that are commonly available and easily recognisable, such as narratives of tragedy and ending. Easy to remember and to spread, the story of the death of the book mirrors both our enthusiasm for what lies ahead, as well as our fear of losing parts of our intimate world \u2013 and finally, of ourselves.", "level": "C2", "diff": 80.71, "fac": 0.671857143, "questions": {"1": {"text": "In the first paragraph, the writer says that recent trends in book sales", "answer": "b", "diff": 86.66,

got up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past four hundred years approached this exact same task \u2013 that is, how they made the time each day to do their best work, how they organized their schedules in order to be creative and productive. By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects\u2019 daily lives \u2013 when they slept and ate and worked and worried \u2013 I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. \u2018Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,\u2019 the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote. I say, \u2018Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.\u2019\nIn that sense, this is a superficial book. It\u2019s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it\u2019s also, inevitably, personal. (The novelist John Cheever thought that you couldn\u2019t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self \u2013 isn\u2019t that the truth?) My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to \u2018work smarter, not harder\u2019, as my dad is always telling me? \nI don\u2019t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages \u2013 probably some of them can\u2019t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises \u2013 but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one\u2019s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \nThe book\u2019s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people\u2019s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot. But in the right hands, your daily routine can be a finely calibrated mechanism for taking advantage of a range of limited resources: time (the most limited resource of all) as well as willpower and optimism. A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one\u2019s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. The psychologist William James thought you wanted to put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can \u2018free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.\u2019 Ironically, James himself was a chronic procrastinator and could never stick to a regular schedule. \nAs it happens, it was an inspired bout of procrastination that led to the creation of this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I\u2019m a classic \u2018morning person\u2019, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers\u2019 working schedules. These were easy to find and highly entertaining. It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place \u2013 hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people\u2019s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I\u2019ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I\u2019ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. In other cases, I have cobbled together a summary of their routines from secondary sources. I should note here that this book would have been impossible without the research of the hundreds of biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I drew upon. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading.", "level": "C2", "diff": 81.22428571, "fac": 0.644428571, "questions": {"1": {"text": "In the first paragraph, the author suggests that one of his aims in the book was to", "answer": "b", "diff": 76.92, "disc": 0.196, "fac": 0.755, "options": {"a": {"text": "show how creativity cannot be planned for.", "disc": 0.0, "fac": 0.0}, "b": {"text": "make great people seem more like the average person.

This recognises that research is not an exclusive activity for established, world-famous scholars at ancient universities or for the scientists who are pushing the boundaries of our knowledge concerning, for example, medical practice, but that it can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way in which we go about building knowledge and skills. Research approaches and skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in employment, because they are ways of thinking about the world, as well as ways of going about your own work.\nAs a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not digest it and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted. Instead, you wonder Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? What do we really make of whatever facts we are given, views we are meant to adopt, or beliefs we are told about? Why does it matter? These and others are the most common questions that underlie what we call research. \nBy research, I am suggesting a continuum of approaches and activities which can be defined at one end of the continuum as the \u2018blue skies\u2019, groundbreaking, highly complex, intellectual, world-shattering, erudite research, which is the traditional view of research carried out full-time by the highly trained few, and leading to substantial change and knowledge. Research has to begin somewhere, though, and at the other end of the continuum, we can define research as a relatively everyday enquiry approach which has a robust research design, involves much careful work and, amongst other things, problematises or asks thoughtful questions about issues, practices, events and fields; follows up hunches; and makes practical suggestions.\nMost students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will have been asking questions which led to the need to carry out some investigation, some research, since you first became interested in studying at all. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.\nAt college and in higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas that you read about or hear about, and constructing your own responses and your own knowledge to add to the debates are all learning activities which are expected of you. Some students may have difficulties with this, as knowledge is seen in some parts of the world as being already established, so that you gain knowledge by listening to and deferring to authority in the form of the teacher and texts. It could seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and known authorities, and you might feel you need to be told what it is important to learn about. But the fact is that in UK, US, much European, and Australasian higher education, established knowledge is to be questioned, as are those who claim to be authorities.

And yet, city life isn't easy. The same London caf\u00e9s that stimulated discussion also helped spread cholera; Picasso eventually decamped to the country. The modern city might be a haven of creativity, but it's also a deeply unnatural and overwhelming place. Now scientists have begun to examine how the city affects the brain, and the results are chastening. While it's long been recognized that city life is exhausting, this new research suggests that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so.\nOne of the main forces at work is a stark lack of something surprisingly beneficial for the brain: nature. Studies have demonstrated, for instance, that hospital patients recover more quickly when they can see trees from their windows. Even these fleeting glimpses of nature improve brain performance, it seems, because they provide a mental break from the urban grind. This research arrives just as humans pass an important milestone: For the first time in history, the majority reside in cities. Instead of inhabiting wide-open spaces, we're crowded into concrete jungles, surrounded by millions of strangers. In recent years, it's become clear that such unnatural surroundings have important implications for our mental and physical health, and can powerfully alter how we think.\nConsider everything your brain has to keep track of as you walk down a busy thoroughfare: distracted pedestrians; hazardous crossings requiring the brain to monitor the flow of traffic (the brain is a wary machine, always alert for potential threats); and the confusing urban grid. The reason such seemingly trivial mental tasks leave us depleted is that they exploit one of the crucial weak spots of the brain. A city is so overstuffed with stimuli that we need to continually redirect our attention. This sort of controlled perception \u2013 telling the brain what to ignore and what not to \u2013 takes energy and effort. The mind is like a powerful supercomputer, but the act of paying attention consumes much of its processing power.\nNatural settings, in contrast, don't require the same amount of cognitive effort. This idea is known as attention restoration theory, and was first developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. While it's long been known that human attention is a scarce resource \u2013 focusing in the morning makes it harder to focus in the afternoon \u2013 Kaplan hypothesized that immersion in nature might have a restorative effect. Natural settings are full of objects that automatically capture our attention, yet they do not trigger any negative emotional responses \u2013 unlike, say, a police siren. The mental machinery that directs attention can relax deeply, replenishing itself.\nIn fact, long before scientists became concerned, philosophers and landscape architects were warning about the effects of the undiluted city, and looking for ways to integrate nature into modern life. Vibrant urban parks, such as Central Park in New York, allow the masses an escape from urban life. A properly designed park can improve the function of the brain within minutes. While people have searched high and low for ways to improve cognitive performance, from energy drinks to redesigning the layout of offices, it appears that few of these treatments are as effective as simply taking a walk in a natural place.\nSo, given the myriad mental problems that are exacerbated by city life, the question remains: Why do cities continue to grow? And why, even in the electronic age, do they endure as wellsprings of intellectual life?\nRecent research at the Santa Fe Institute demonstrated that the very same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory \u2013 the crowded streets, the sheer crushing closeness of people \u2013 also correlate with measures of innovation. It is the \u2018concentration of social interactions\u2019 that is largely responsible for urban creativity, according to scientists. Just as the crowded nature of 18th-century London led to intellectual breakthroughs, the crowded nature of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, contributes to its success as a creative center of technology. Equally, less crowded urban areas may, over time, generate less innovation. The key, then, is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits.

This might sound like an odd question: surely, thinking takes place inside people\u2019s heads.  Nowadays, we even have sophisticated neuroimaging techniques to prove it.  As deeply intuitive as this assumption about the boundaries of the mind may be, I see no compelling reason why the study of the mind should stop at the skin or the skull.  There is an abundance of evidence, ranging from earliest prehistory to the present, to testify that things, as well as neurons, participate in human cognitive life.  From the viewpoint of archaeology, it is clear that stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.  Consequently, I suggest that what is outside the head may not necessarily be outside the mind.\nIt is easy to see how the mind and the brain became equated.  Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them.  This makes good sense if you are a neuroscientist, because of the constraints imposed by using a brain-scanning machine.  But as a result, it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.  Naturally, I do not mean to question the neural basis of cognition, but to point out that mind is more than a brain.  Instead, it would be more productive to explore the hypothesis that human intelligence \u2018spreads out\u2019 beyond the skin into culture and the material world.  \nThis is where a new theory I\u2019ve developed \u2013 Material Engagement Theory (MET) \u2013 comes in.  At its heart, MET aims to explore the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body, such as when one makes numbers and symbols out of clay, or uses a stone to strike another, forming a tool.  It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory, and what those changes mean for the ways we think.  This approach gives a new insight into what minds are, and what they are made of, by changing what we know about what things do for the mind.\nThink of a blind person with a stick.  Where does this person\u2019s self begin?  The unity of the blind man and the stick offers a way to conceptualise minds and things as continuous, but it also provides an analogy for the profound plasticity of the human mind: using a stick, the blind man turns touch into sight, but the stick has its own interesting active role.  Tactile sensation is projected onto the point of contact between the tip of the stick and the outside environment.  As a result, the brain treats the stick as part of the body.\nThe blind man\u2019s stick reminds us of something that many people forget; namely, that it is in the nature of human intelligence to remain amenable to drastic, deep reorganisation by incorporating new technological innovations.  My approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution.  It is important to keep in mind that, whatever actual form the \u2018stick\u2019 might have taken in the history of our species \u2013 from the earliest Palaeolithic stone tools to the internet \u2013 its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary.  Through the \u2018stick\u2019, the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward.\nThat is why a stick used by a monkey to retrieve food is of a different kind.  For humans, \u2018sticks\u2019 are used to satisfy our desire to know.  This unique human predisposition for engagement with material culture explains why we humans, more than any other species, make things, and how those things, in return, make our minds what they are.  I call that metaplasticity \u2013 we have plastic minds that develop and change as they interact with the material world.  I want to put materiality back into the cognitive equation.  MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture, from the stone hand-axe to the latest smartphone, may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think.
