{"id": 19, "title": "A musician and his pupil\nPaul Williams interviews the famous pianist Alfred Brendel", "text": "Over six decades the pianist Alfred Brendel gradually built up and maintained a dominant position in the world of classical music. He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel\u2019s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn\u2019t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: \u2018You don\u2019t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.\u2019 But there was something that struck him about the young boy \u2013 then about 14. He listened to him play. Brendel explained, \u2018He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, \u201cI have to make time for him.\u201d It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note. It\u2019s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.\u2019\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it \u2013 restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons \u2013 always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. \u2018This was very important,\u2019 Brendel says. \u2018To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.\u2019\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. \u2018Now I don\u2019t want to raise any expectations. I\u2019m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it\u2019s like the worst thing. One doesn\u2019t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection\u2019.\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains \u2018When I was very young, I didn\u2019t have the urge to be famous in five year\u2019s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on. Although I do not have the physical power now, in my head, there are always things going on, all sorts of pieces that I\u2019ve never played. I don\u2019t play now but it\u2019s a very nice new career.\u2019", "level": "B2", "diff": 66.17, "fac": 0.535714286, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What is the writer emphasising in the first paragraph?", "answer": "b", "diff": 65.88, "disc": 0.457, "fac": 0.548, "options": {"a": {"text": "the wide range of music that Brendel has played", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.11}, "b": {"text": "the total dedication of Brendel to his art", "disc": 0.46, "fac": 0.55}, "c": {"text": "the reluctance of Brendel to take on pupils", "disc": -0.06, "fac": 0.08}, "d": {"text": "the light hearted nature of Brendel\u2019s character", "disc": -0.26, "fac": 0.26}}}, "2": {"text": "Brendel uses the quotation about the mountain guide to illustrate that", "answer": "d", "diff": 65.54, "disc": 0.386, "fac": 0.556, "options": {"a": {"text": "it is not always easy to teach people the basics.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.14}, "b": {"text": "it is unwise to try to teach new skills before people are ready.", "disc": -0.11, "fac": 0.19}, "c": {"text": "people can learn new skills without help from others.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.1}, "d": {"text": "it is unnecessary for an expert to teach people the basics.", "disc": 0.39, "fac": 0.56}}}, "3": {"text": "What made Brendel first decide to accept Kit as a pupil?", "answer": "d", "diff": 51.71, "disc": 0.296, "fac": 0.831, "options": {"a": {"text": "He seemed so young and serious.", "disc": 0.08, "fac": 0.02}, "b": {"text": "He was so determined and persistent.", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.09}, "c": {"text": "He could play without the music.", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.06}, "d": {"text": "He had an extraordinary talent.", "disc": 0.3, "fac": 0.83}}}, "4": {"text": "What is said about Brendel\u2019s attitude to Kit\u2019s progress?", "answer": "a", "diff": 78.79, "disc": 0.24, "fac": 0.258, "options": {"a": {"text": "He is anxious that Kit does not try to do too much too quickly.", "disc": 0.24, "fac": 0.26}, "b": {"text": "He is worried that Kit might be distracted by his other interests.", "disc": 0.11, "fac": 0.47}, "c": {"text": "He is sad that Kit may replace him in the world of classical music.", "disc": -0.25, "fac": 0.1}, "d": {"text": "He is frustrated that Kit is so influenced by his mother.", "disc": -0.22, "fac": 0.17}}}, "5": {"text": "Which of Kit\u2019s musical abilities does Brendel admire the most?", "answer": "b", "diff": 63.48, "disc": 0.434, "fac": 0.605, "options": {"a": {"text": "He is able to write music himself.", "disc": -0.04, "fac": 0.07}, "b": {"text": "He is able to understand and respond to advice.", "disc": 0.43, "fac": 0.6}, "c": {"text": "He can play a piece of music the first time he sees it.", "disc": -0.32, "fac": 0.16}, "d": {"text": "He is able to remember all the music he has ever played.", "disc": -0.22, "fac": 0.16}}}, "6": {"text": "Why does the writer use the phrase \u2018catches himself\u2019 in line 51?", "answer": "a", "diff": 70.24, "disc": 0.242, "fac": 0.444, "options": {"a": {"text": "He realises he has said too much to a journalist.", "disc": 0.24, "fac": 0.44}, "b": {"text": "He doesn\u2019t enjoy giving interviews to journalists.", "disc": -0.29, "fac": 0.14}, "c": {"text": "He wants to be careful he doesn\u2019t upset any music critics.", "disc": 0.01, "fac": 0.22}, "d": {"text": "He resents the way that he has often been misquoted.", "disc": -0.06, "fac": 0.2}}}, "7": {"text": "What is Brendel doing in the final paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 67.55, "disc": 0.478, "fac": 0.508, "options": {"a": {"text": "justifying his lack of ambition when he was young", "disc": -0.32, "fac": 0.31}, "b": {"text": "expressing regret at the loss of his physical strength", "disc": -0.1, "fac": 0.15}, "c": {"text": "describing his present state of mind", "disc": 0.48, "fac": 0.51}, "d": {"text": "explaining which pieces he prefers to play now", "disc": -0.31, "fac": 0.03}}}}}/n{"id": 20, "title": "Green fingers", "text": "It never occurred to me when I was little that gardens were anything less than glamorous places. Grandad\u2019s garden was not situated in some grimy city. Instead it was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn\u2019t reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this \u2013 a place of escape, peace and solitude. Grandad\u2019s plot was nothing out of the ordinary when it came to features. He had nothing as grand as a greenhouse, unlike some of his neighbours. Not that they had proper \u2018bought\u2019 greenhouses. Theirs were made from old window frames. Patches of plastic would be tacked in place where a carelessly wielded spade had smashed a pane of glass.\nAt home, his son, my father, could be quiet and withdrawn. I wouldn\u2019t want to make him sound humourless. He wasn\u2019t. Silly things would amuse him. He had phrases that he liked to use, \u2018It\u2019s immaterial to me\u2019 being one of them. \u2018I don\u2019t mind\u2019 would have done just as well but he liked the word \u2018immaterial\u2019. Deep down he was probably disappointed that he hadn\u2019t made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. Plumbing was not something he was passionate about. It was just what he did. He was never particularly ambitious, though there was a moment when he and Mum thought of emigrating to Canada, but it came to nothing. Where he came into his own was around the house. He had an \u2018eye for the job\u2019. Be it bookshelves or a cupboard \u2013 what he could achieve was astonishing.\nMy parents moved house only once in their entire married life. But my mother made up for this lack of daring when it came to furniture. You would just get used to the shape of one chair when another appeared, but the most dramatic change of all was the arrival of a piano. I always wanted to like it but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. \u2018They\u2019re too posh\u2019, my mother said and they disappeared while I was at school. There was never any mention of my being allowed to play it. Instead lessons were booked for my sister. When I asked my mother in later life why I wasn\u2019t given the opportunity, her reply was brief: \u2018You\u2019d never have practised\u2019.\nOf the three options, moors, woods or river \u2013 the river was the one that usually got my vote. On a stretch of the river I was allowed to disappear with my imagination into another world. With a fishing net over my shoulder I could set off in sandals that were last year\u2019s model, with the fronts cut out to accommodate toes that were now right to the end. I\u2019d walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home. After the first disastrous attempts to keep them alive in the back yard, they were tipped back into the water.\nI wanted out of school as soon as possible but that seemed an unlikely prospect until one day my father announced, \u2018They\u2019ve got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.\u2019 In one brief moment Dad had gone against his better judgement. He might still have preferred it if I became a carpenter. But I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him was a feeling that things might just turn out for the best. If I stuck at it. Maybe I\u2019m deceiving myself, but I prefer to believe that somewhere in his heart, although he hated gardening himself, he\u2019d watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn\u2019t disappeared.", "level": "B2", "diff": 68.36571429, "fac": 0.539428571, "questions": {"1": {"text": "When the writer describes his grandad\u2019s garden, his tone is", "answer": "d", "diff": 59.7, "disc": 0.319, "fac": 0.727, "options": {"a": {"text": "proud that his granddad is such a good gardener.", "disc": -0.09, "fac": 0.17}, "b": {"text": "embarrassed that the garden was not as good as others nearby.", "disc": -0.28, "fac": 0.08}, "c": {"text": "indignant that items in the garden were often damaged.", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.02}, "d": {"text": "nostalgic about the time he spent in the garden.", "disc": 0.32, "fac": 0.73}}}, "2": {"text": "What is the writer\u2019s attitude to his father in the second paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 67.82, "disc": 0.16, "fac": 0.554, "options": {"a": {"text": "regretful that his father had not achieved more", "disc": -0.12, "fac": 0.4}, "b": {"text": "irritated that his father used words he didn\u2019t understand", "disc": 0.03, "fac": 0.03}, "c": {"text": "sympathetic to the reasons why his father behaved as he did", "disc": 0.16, "fac": 0.55}, "d": {"text": "grateful that his father had not taken the family to Canada", "disc": 0.0, "fac": 0.0}}}, "3": {"text": "What does the writer mean by the phrase \u2018came into his own\u2019 in line 15?", "answer": "b", "diff": 67.82, "disc": 0.495, "fac": 0.554, "options": {"a": {"text": "was able to do something by himself", "disc": -0.22, "fac": 0.24}, "b": {"text": "was able to show how talented he was", "disc": 0.49, "fac": 0.55}, "c": {"text": "was able to continue his day job", "disc": -0.23, "fac": 0.06}, "d": {"text": "was able to forget his rejection", "disc": -0.25, "fac": 0.13}}}, "4": {"text": "What was the writer\u2019s initial reaction to the piano?", "answer": "a", "diff": 73.62, "disc": 0.254, "fac": 0.421, "options": {"a": {"text": "surprise when it suddenly appeared", "disc": 0.25, "fac": 0.42}, "b": {"text": "pleasure at seeing it in the living room", "disc": -0.34, "fac": 0.06}, "c": {"text": "jealousy that only his sister would have piano lessons", "disc": 0.04, "fac": 0.47}, "d": {"text": "pride that his mother had listened to his advice", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.03}}}, "5": {"text": "The writer\u2019s description of his fishing trips illustrate", "answer": "d", "diff": 67.45, "disc": 0.489, "fac": 0.562, "options": {"a": {"text": "how much free time he was given.", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.11}, "b": {"text": "how beautiful the river was.", "disc": -0.16, "fac": 0.24}, "c": {"text": "how good a fisherman he was.", "disc": -0.34, "fac": 0.07}, "d": {"text": "how carefree his childhood was.", "disc": 0.49, "fac": 0.56}}}, "6": {"text": "What is the main idea of the last paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 73.62, "disc": 0.338, "fac": 0.421, "options": {"a": {"text": "His father did not want his son to be a gardener.", "disc": -0.11, "fac": 0.21}, "b": {"text": "His father was tired of disagreeing with his son.", "disc": -0.12, "fac": 0.04}, "c": {"text": "His father had been impressed by his son\u2019s love of gardening.", "disc": 0.34, "fac": 0.42}, "d": {"text": "His father had been trying to find a job his son would enjoy.", "disc": -0.15, "fac": 0.31}}}, "7": {"text": "What does the writer mean by the phrase \u2018If I stuck at it\u2019 in line 35?", "answer": "b", "diff": 68.53, "disc": 0.419, "fac": 0.537, "options": {"a": {"text": "listened to his father\u2019s advice", "disc": -0.13, "fac": 0.24}, "b": {"text": "continued to work hard", "disc": 0.42, "fac": 0.54}, "c": {"text": "took the job immediately", "disc": -0.14, "fac": 0.12}, "d": {"text": "remained at school", "disc": -0.06, "fac": 0.05}}}}}/n{"id": 21, "title": "The Isle of Muck\nJim Richardson visits the Scottish island of Muck", "text": "Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. And so do I. An Atlantic gale threatens to lift and blow us both out like October leaves, over the steep cliff at our feet and across the bay 120m below, dropping us in the surrounding ocean. Then MacEwen\u2019s sheepdog, Tie, creeps up and his blond, bearded owner strokes him with gentle hands. The howling wind, rage as it might, can\u2019t make this man uncomfortable here, on his island, where he looks \u2013 and is \u2013 perfectly at home.\nMacEwen is giving me a visual tour of his neighbourhood. Nodding to the north, he yells, \u2018That island is Eigg. The one to the west of it is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.\u2019 I watch heavy clouds dump rain on its huge mountains. \u2018Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.\u2019 \u2018I have sheep to move,\u2019 MacEwen abruptly announces when rain drifts towards us. We start down the slopes. As we stride along, he brings me up to speed on island details: Volcanic Muck is  three km long and half as wide; its geese eat vast amounts of grass; and the MacEwens have been living here for 3000 years.\nHerding the sheep interrupts the flow of information. Tie, the sheepdog, is circling a flock of sheep \u2013 and not doing it well. \u2018Away to me, Tie. Away to me,\u2019 meaning the dog should circle to the right. He doesn\u2019t; he goes straight up the middle of the flock, creating confusion. \u2018Tie.\u2019 MacEwen\u2019s voice drips disappointment. \u2018That will never do.\u2019 The dog looks ashamed.\nThe Isle of Muck is largely a MacEwen enterprise. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; son Colin, newly married, manages the island cottages; and daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby love the fact that their two boys can wander the island on their own and sail dinghies on summer days. \u2018They go out of the door and come back only when they\u2019re hungry.\u2019 But island life has its compromises. For one, electricity is only available part of the time. My first evening, I wait anxiously for the lights to turn on. The next morning I find Mary setting out breakfast by torchlight. But I cope with it \u2013 along with no mobile phone service. \u2018There is mobile reception on the hill,\u2019 Mary tells me. \u2018Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.\u2019 So I do too.\nEverything on Muck seems delightfully improbable. The boat today brings over some groceries \u2013 and three musicians, who hop off carrying instruments. Their concert in the island\u2019s tearoom proves a smash hit, with the islanders present tapping their boots in time to the music. That night, sitting by a glowing fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. \u2018Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay advertised in the newspaper, and bought it without even looking at it. He\u2019d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.\u2019 Did Jenny know anything about running a farm? \u2018She had good typing skills.\u2019\nI go to bed with rain and awake to more rain. But I eat well, virtually every last morsel of food coming from the tiny island. Mary sends me down to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, delicious beyond reckoning. Also beyond reckoning: my ferry ride the following morning to my next island. Over the preceding two months, many of the scheduled ferries had been cancelled because of high seas. If my ferry didn\u2019t come, I\u2019d be stuck on Muck for two more days.

Often, perhaps unfairly, viewed as just a hobby for young enthusiasts, the video games industry is now being taken seriously. Surprised? Industry experts aren\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s not easy though. Video game spin-offs that rapidly follow any new movie require dozens of team members and months of incredible skill, perseverance and intricacies. As with almost every industry, it\u2019s tricky to get into \u2013 but it is expanding. Jim Donelly, a spokesman for an online games magazine says: \u2018It\u2019s certainly very difficult to make much headway within big companies, or to influence any of the really big mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.\u2019\nSo, how can you get into such a competitive industry? Although many companies prefer people  to have a degree in computer science, Jim disagrees. \u2018There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won\u2019t get a job if you haven\u2019t made something, and you won\u2019t get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff. Game design is less a job than it is a way of life. Like any creative endeavour it must be done to be real.\u2019 Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options. \u2018There\u2019s a lot to be said for \u201cjust doing it\u201d, but it\u2019s really more complicated than that. There are lots of people who want to work in games, but few who measure up to the requirements of the industry these days; even fewer who have the creative talent, technical know-how, vision and entrepreneurial ability to really contribute to the ever-changing face of an evolving medium.\u2019\nCan you do it on your own? \u2018Perhaps, but it\u2019s pretty tricky,\u2019 says John. \u2018However, a good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. Most games designers start their careers as programmers, or artists, progressing their way up the ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment media, plus have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. They may or may not have spent a few years in the working world post-graduation, but have realised that games is going to be their \u201cthing\u201d. They are not merely fans, but are fascinated by the future possibilities of games, and are aware of the increasing breadth and diversity of the form. And finally connections can help. This is often overlooked, but in order to get ahead in games \u2013 as in many other areas \u2013 you need to network.\u2019\nThe childish stereotype of the adolescent boy glued to his games console has long been replaced by the more accurate perception of a grown-up medium, grabbing our attention. Families frequently get involved on interactive consoles. Smart phones introduce a wealth of new games through apps, as well as social media. John believes there is plenty of room for expansion. \u2018Games have become pervasive play-things for increasingly large audiences.

I think I was programmed by my dad to some extent and he encouraged me to play. It wasn\u2019t imposed on me, though, and I\u2019m grateful for that. I had a friend who used to come to the park with us and his dad was really pushy. He was always saying, \u2018You can\u2019t do this, you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 My mate could have been a good player, but he just stopped wanting to play and has never been involved in football since. I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t turn out that way for me, but I realise that things could have easily been so different.\nWhen I score a heart\u2013stopping goal from a long way out, people often say that it\u2019s just luck, but it isn\u2019t. I have worked on taking shots at goal from a distance since I was a kid. It\u2019s only by practising that you get to score the spectacular goals which give you such a buzz. The best players in the world, who obviously have amazing natural talent, would never have achieved what they have without years and years of practice. Sometimes you see young players crashing into each other, but I was taught technique. If I\u2019m teaching kids, the most important thing I try to get across is to enjoy learning skills. \nI used to do every sport going at school. I\u2019d get involved in anything, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now it\u2019s important to get a good education, but football was the only thing on my mind then. The teachers were doing a pretty good job, but I wasn\u2019t aware of it at the time. I don\u2019t want it to be like that for my son. We\u2019re already trying to read him books even though he\u2019s far too young to sit still for long enough. I hope the fact that he usually wants to kick them around on the floor doesn\u2019t mean that he takes after me in that way.\nAt the beginning of my professional football career, the manager made big sacrifices so that some of us younger players could move up to play for the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He never called us together and said, \u2018This is your big chance to prove yourselves\u2019 but we all knew we had to. Although I scored in the opening game of the season, we lost, and a respected TV presenter famously said, \u2018You can\u2019t win anything with kids\u2019. That really made us aware of how much we had to do. You always have a few doubts, but we had faith in ourselves as a team despite what he said. \nI rely on close friends and family a lot. But having so much money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people sometimes say to me, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you let your mother carry on working.\u2019 Of course I\u2019ve helped out my parents financially. I paid off the loan on their house and I bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong individuals and I think they would be offended at the idea that they should somehow be on the payroll. My mum doesn\u2019t earn a lot as a hairdresser but she loves what she does. On the other hand, it gives me a lot of pleasure to use my money to make things a bit easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people say, but that doesn\u2019t give me all the answers. \nAfter I\u2019ve stopped playing, I think I\u2019ll have a year off or perhaps even longer, doing the things I haven\u2019t been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can\u2019t do that now because if I were to break a leg on the ski slopes and couldn\u2019t play football again, I wouldn\u2019t be insured.", "level": "B2", "diff": 60.91857143, "fac": 0.537, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What do we learn about the footballer\u2019s childhood?", "answer": "c", "diff": 56.74, "disc": 0.494, "fac": 0.638, "options": {"a": {"text": "He only started playing football in order to please his father.", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.11}, "b": {"text": "He sometimes resented his father\u2019s ambition for him.

Sam was my father\u2019s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile. But now, with the hot weather, the place flowered with people.\nAnd so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity. My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind. Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\nRusty was a dog. My dog. When we first moved to Reef Point we hadn\u2019t got a dog, so Rusty decided to remedy this. Accordingly he hung around. I chased him off and he returned, unrepentant. One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force. Rusty knew this and moved in a little nearer. I asked my father, \u2018Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us\u2019.\nYou\u2019re wrong Jane,\u2019 replied my father. \u2018He thinks we belong to him.\u2019\nRusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up \u2013 a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners. He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. You\u2019d have thought he\u2019d have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\nWe had been swimming that day. Father, the deadline met, had driven down to Los Angeles to deliver the script in person, and Rusty and I had kept each other company in and out of the sea all afternoon. But now, the setting sun gold, it was getting cooler and we sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. They chose a wave and stood, a poem of balance, as the water curved up, riding the wave until it swept onto the sand.\nOne surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs. But now she seemed to decide to call it a day and rode in on a final wave.\nHi,\u2019 she said, \u2018why didn\u2019t you join us?\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t got a surfboard.\u2019\n\u2018You could get one.\u2019\n\u2018No money.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re British, aren\u2019t you?

The queues, by now spilling out of the cattle shed marked \u2018Departures\u2019, to board the Queen Caroline where long and none was moving. \u2018It\u2019s best to get to the docks late\u2019, her friend Annie had advised. \u2018If you get there too early you can grow roots hanging about.\u2019 Annie, married to a diplomat and full of advice, was a seasoned traveller. But on this occasion her advice was mistaken.\nAfter a while an announcement came through the loudspeakers: there had been a \u2018breakdown in the computer system.\u2019 In the face of this setback the atmosphere among the waiting passengers darkened. Some attempted patience, some brave souls even tried to rise to jollity but for the most part the mood became rebellious. They had paid good money \u2013 through the nose, many were inclined to feel \u2013 for this voyage. This might be their last chance for a bit of luxury. That they could not even be got aboard efficiently did not promise well.\nViolet\u2019s own instinct was to turn tail. She felt in her bag for her phone and discovered that it was missing. This was a good deal more annoying than the length of the queues. It confirmed an uneasy sense that the whole idea of a cruise was one of her mistakes. And now there was the nuisance of the phone. She couldn\u2019t ring the minicab company to check whether she had left it in the taxi, because that number \u2013 along with all her other numbers \u2013 was stored in her phone. The very error that her elder son Harry was always  counselling her to avoid.\nBehind her in the queue, stood an approachable-looking couple. \u2018I\u2019m sorry but, stupidly, I seem to have left my mobile phone behind. I couldn\u2019t borrow yours to make one call, could I?\u2019 Violet rang Harry on the obliging couple\u2019s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbour, if she would check to see whether the phone had been left behind. It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them. Dan might easily forget to give the message to Kristina at all.\nEventually the queues started to move forward and Violet was ushered towards a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to go aboard. Her heart sank further in the ship\u2019s foyer which resembled one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high. There were panels of shining fake walnut, extravagant cascades of chandeliers, polished brass plating and carpets patterned in the style commonly found at airports.\nViolet followed the signs to the \u2018Elevators\u2019 which were lined floor to ceiling with mirrors and crammed with passengers who, bedraggled from early morning starts, luggage disposal and the incurable anxiety induced by travel arrangements, might have preferred to be spared the sight of their multiple reflections.

Malloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago, in the US. Instead, what he found were 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images.\nSince then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier\u2019s life and work. Stashed in the attic studio of his home are her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints and 100,000 negatives, as well as many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent weekday morning, Maloof stood in the midst of it all and looked around. He knows he\u2019s on the verge of something pretty cool, and it came about by pure luck. \u2018When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,\u2019 Maloof said. \u2018I\u2019m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.\u2019\nFor some time now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been stitching together the details of Maier\u2019s life and trying to fill in the blanks. They contacted several local families that employed her as a nanny and talked with employees of the shop where she had film developed. Maier was born in 1926 in new York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who by all accounts kept herself to herself and was a bit of a character, always had a camera with her. She dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes.\n\u2018First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be round her neck, and we wouldn\u2019t see her again until late at night,\u2019 said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employer Maier to care for his daughter. \u2018I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.\u2019\nMaier was knowledgeable about theatre and movies. Although she was by no means sociable, she wasn\u2019t afraid to walk the street with herm camera and engage people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seems to have been somewhat obsessed with her \u2018second job\u2019, documenting the world around her. \u2018She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,\u2019 said Rydzon. \u2018She didn\u2019t let anyone or anything stop her.\u2019\nMaier\u2019s work is the purest form of art; none of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, the abstract. \u2018What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,\u2019 said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and he wonders whether she developed her own style independently. \u2018Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or was she a lifter of ideas from those who came before her?\u2019\nMaloof often wonders if he\u2019ll ever work his way through all the negatives, which he has stored in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier\u2019s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures.\n?As I progressed as a photographer and went back and visited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It\u2019s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,\u2019 he said. \u2018There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined.

Not so with Eleanor Catton\u2019s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK at a time when the book\u2019s success had placed her at the centre of a publicity whirlwind, but she seemed very calm especially considering she was still in her twenties. She had just flown in from Germany, and was flying home to New Zealand the following day. She told me a story of once being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel up against the glass. The official peered at it and asked, \u2018Well, what\u2019s it about?\u2019\nNot a simple question for an author. The Luminaries is set during the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have been committed, and a council of 12 men has convened to solve them. The plot then becomes incredibly complex. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal wth. At more than 800 pages, it is \u2018big by necessity\u2019, because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters \u2018a decent show\u2019.\nWhen I ask how it feels to be so successful at such a young age, she answers with a neat deflection. \u2018It\u2019s so nice coming from a small country in times like this, because everybody feels like the success is partly theirs. There\u2019s a very familial feeling at home, I got a lot of back pats from other people\u2019s grandmas.\u2019 Then she adds, carefully: \u2018What is annoying is when it is assumed that what I\u2019m trying to do in the book is not a philosophical enterprise.\u2019\n\u2018I lit upon this idea that I wanted to try and write the book in the shape of a spiral. Every part was half the length of the part before it,\u2019 said Catton. It literally speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters whether the reader notices these things. \u2018What I wanted to create with The Luminaries is a book that had structural patterns built in that didn\u2019t matter, but if you cared about them, you could look into the book and see them.\u2019\nDespite the experimental structure of The Luminaries, the book remains an exciting murder mystery with an absorbing plot. Surprisingly for anyone who\u2019s read the novel, she says she didn\u2019t work out what it would be beforehand. \u2018I just would try and write myself into a corner, and then see how imaginative I could be in writing myself out of this impossible situation I\u2019d created for myself.\u2019  Refreshingly, it\u2019s clear one of her goals was also to make the book fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of television drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries wields cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints and dialogue. I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. \u2018That could be pretty cool,\u2019 she says.\nHer conversation bubbles with enthusiasm, punctuated with a low, conspiratorial laugh. She lights up when talking about her craft, and about New Zealand. \u2018I always notice when I come over to Britain how much the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to extremely populated areas, to have that saturation of other human beings.\u2019 But for the time being at least, New Zealand will continue to be her home.

And the two preoccupations have been his living for the past four decades: building steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. \u2018I\u2019m still in thrall to the guitar,\u2019 he says. \u2018How is it that by simply putting together two planks of wood, you can create a beautiful sound? And by using different combinations of timber, you produce different sounds? Even now, it fills me with wonder.\u2019\nJonny learned to play his brother\u2019s guitar when he was eleven. Then, when he was sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. \u2018Some people would\u2019ve got a holiday job and saved up for one,\u2019 he says. \u2018But I was of a mindset that if you wanted something, you created it yourself. I studied guitars and figured out how different shapes and types of wood affected the sound, and how you could put them together.\u2019\nAlthough the bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, he and his brothers had long been doing essentially the same thing with other items. \u2018We drew model boats and aeroplanes and then constructed them, so I was familiar with the process. My father had taught us how to use saws, sharpen chisels, and stuff like that. I\u2019d actually been customising and repairing instruments for my mates, too.\u2019\nJonny\u2019s bass guitar turned out well, but the idea of a career building guitars had yet to cross his mind. \u2018I was also into painting and sculpture,\u2019 he says. His interests evolved further and on finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. \u2018Architecture involves design, which I was interested in, and a career as an architect seemed a good idea at the time,\u2019 he remembers. Halfway through the course, however, he dropped out. \u2018I was too individualistic for it,\u2019 he says. \u2018But I did leave with a clearer sense of what I wanted to do. I was still into sculpture, but I\u2019d worked out that guitar-building is actually a type of sculpture \u2013 one that involves sculpting sound. And I thought it might be a more realistic thing to do than pure art because you\u2019re making things that people use.\u2019\nEver since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he supplemented his income by cleaning windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only went for the cost of the materials, but as he developed a reputation as one of the best guitar-makers around, he was able to charge a little more. But even now, almost forty years later, Jonny describes what he does as \u2018still scratching a living\u2019. He admits he can never actually turn out more than ten guitars a year, which inevitably restricts his earnings.\nIn the early years, the key thing was to make the effort to get himself known. He would go to music festivals most weekends if he could and get musicians to try out his guitars and talk about him to their friends. He also had to learn how to price his instruments \u2013 when it came up in conversations with musicians, he hadn\u2019t got an answer because focusing on such things didn\u2019t come naturally to him. \nJonny believes developing a career is more straightforward for today\u2019s new guitar-makers in the UK. \u2018When I started, a common perception was that the only acoustic guitars worth having were ones made in the USA,\u2019 he says. \u2018UK-made guitars weren\u2019t seen as the real thing, even though we\u2019ve always had good instrument-making courses here and the technology and skills involved have remained pretty much constant. But now the quality of our hand-made guitars has the reputation it deserves.\u2019\nJonny says that valuable techniques can be acquired in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should do the courses on offer.

And in this spirit of observing traditional procedure, I shall, like every other writer on Englishness, quote the famous comment of the eighteenth-century diarist Dr Johnson that, \u2018When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather\u2019, and point out that this observation is as accurate now as it was over two hundred years ago.\nThis, however, is the point at which most commentators either stop or try, and fail, to come up with a convincing explanation for the English \u2018obsession\u2019 with the weather. They fail because they start with this mistaken premise: they assume that our conversations about the weather are actually conversations about the weather. In other words, they assume that English people talk about the weather because they have a keen interest in the subject. Most commentators try to figure out what it is about the English weather that is so fascinating.\nThe American writer Bill Bryson, for example, observes that the English weather is not at all fascinating, and therefore that the national obsession with it is inexplicable: \u2018To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it. All those phenomena that elsewhere give nature an edge of excitement, unpredictability and danger \u2013 tornadoes, monsoons, raging blizzards, huge hailstorms \u2013 are almost wholly unknown in the British Isles.\u2019\nThe English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman objects to Bryson\u2019s dismissive comments, and argues that English weather is actually fascinating. \u2018Bryson misses the point. The English fixation with the weather is nothing to do with deep emotion \u2013 like the English countryside, it is, for the most part, dramatically undramatic. The interest is less in the phenomena themselves but in its uncertainty\u2026one of those things you can say about England with absolute certainty is that it has a lot of weather. It may not include tropical cyclones, but life at the edge of an ocean and the edge of a continent means you can never be entirely sure what you are going to get.\u2019\nMy research has convinced me that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the point, which is that our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all: English weather-speak is a kind of code, evolved to help English people overcome their natural reserve and actually talk to each other. Everyone knows, for example, that \u2018Nice day, isn\u2019t it?\u2019, \u2018Ooh, isn\u2019t it cold?\u2019 and other variations on the theme are not requests for meteorological data: they are fixed greetings, conversation starters or fillers to fall back on in conversations. In other words, English weather-speak is a form of \u2018grooming talk\u2019 \u2013 the human equivalent of what is known as \u2018social grooming\u2019 among monkeys and apes, who spend hours grooming each other\u2019s fur, even when it is perfectly clean, as a means of social bonding.\nThere are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used. Other writers have claimed that the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is an inaccurate observation: in fact, there are three quite specific contexts in which weather-speak is prescribed. It can be used as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters or as a \u2018default\u2019 or \u2018filler\u2019 topic when conversation on other matters dries up and there is an embarrassing pause or uncomfortable silence. Admittedly, this does allow for rather a lot of weather-speak \u2013 so outsiders gain the impression that English people talk of little else. An English conversation may well start with a weather-speak greeting, progress to a bit more weather-speak ice-breaking, and then \u2018default\u2019 to weather-speak at regular intervals.

She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she\u2019d taken a big step into the unknown. \u2018Teaching is like acting, it\u2019s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn\u2019t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I\u2019m still in touch with children through the fiction.\u2019\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today\u2019s fiction for children. \u2018A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,\u2019 she is quick to add, \u2018but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.\u2019\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects \u2013 lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy \u2013 and is spurred on by her love of children. \u2018I\u2019m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It\u2019s all down to me to make it work at that point.\u2019\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was finally inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the seeds lay in the prospect of the \u2018empty nest\u2019 approaching as her two sons were leaving home, and an unexpected recommendation from her head teacher that she would enjoy a residential creative writing course. Alice was taken aback. \u2018I\u2019d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn\u2019t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn\u2019t think was necessary.\u2019\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. \u2018I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.\u2019 Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analysed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader \u2013 his assistance in editing the novel was key. Says Alice, \u2018My mother-in-law thinks we\u2019re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I\u2019ve got on the page \u2013 he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it\u2019s not working he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene.

In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\n\u2018I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u2019 Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. \u2018I\u2019ve never done anything like this before: it\u2019s exciting! These roads have beautiful views \u2013 and also it\u2019s very cold at the moment, so I\u2019ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.\u2019 Alistair was similarly eager \u2013 though in contrast to Jonny\u2019s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. \u2018To be honest,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen his driving before, so I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.\u2019\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire\u2019s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps \u2013 but with Alistair\u2019s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\nJonny\u2019s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. \u2018Welcome to Yorkshire,\u2019 he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. \u2018If Alistair beats me, it\u2019s all down to this farmer!\u2019 Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car \u2013 and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself \u2013 approaching the finish from the other side.

You bounce the ball soundlessly up and down on the soft grass surface; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and you hear the echo of your own shot. And of every shot after that. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, the respectful crowds, all combine to enclose and cushion you from the outside world. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for my game. What I battle against hardest in a tennis match is to shut everything out of my mind but the contest itself and the point I\u2019m playing.\nThe silence of the Centre Court is broken by a shock of noise when a point\u2019s done: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but as if from some place far off. I don\u2019t register that there are fifteen thousand people hunched around the arena, tracking every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused I have no sense at all that there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final \u2013 the biggest match of my life.\nI had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach all my life, had drummed into me from an early age that this was the biggest tournament of them all. By the time I was 14, I was sharing with my friends the fantasy that I\u2019d play there one day and win. Before 2008, though, I\u2019d played and lost, both times against Federer \u2013 in the final there the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. I went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that, having just turned twenty, I\u2019d made it that far. Federer beat me pretty easily, more easily than if I\u2019d gone out with more belief. But my defeat in 2007 left me utterly destroyed. I knew I could have done better, that it was not my ability or the quality of my game that had failed me, but my head. I wept after that loss. I cried incessantly for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts much more when you have a chance and throw it away.\nToni, the toughest of tennis coaches, is usually the last person in the world to offer me consolation; he criticizes me even when I win. It is a measure of what a wreck I must have been that he abandoned the habit of a lifetime and told me there was no reason to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and more Wimbledon finals. I told him he didn\u2019t understand, that this had probably been my last chance to win it. I am keenly aware of how short the life of a professional athlete is, and I want to make the best of it while it lasts. Every single moment counts but some moments count for more than others, and I had let a big one pass in 2007.\nThere was nothing Toni could do to ease my grief. Yet he turned out, in the end, to be right. Another chance had come my way. Here I was again in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I\u2019d learnt the lesson from that defeat twelve months earlier; that whatever else gave way this time, my head would not. The best sign that my head was in the right place now was the conviction that I would win.\nAt dinner with family and friends and team members the night before the final, at the house we always rent when I play at Wimbledon, mention of the match had been off limits. I didn\u2019t expressly forbid them from raising the subject, but they all understood well enough that, whatever else I might have been talking about, I was already beginning to play the match in a space inside my head.

Her name was Jane Goodall.\nIn 1963, Britain\u2019s National Geographical Society promoted Jane Goodall\u2019s fame by producing a series of glossy articles and television documentaries on her chimpanzee research. That early fame has since been reinforced by her own writing for a popular audience, including award-winning children\u2019s books and the 1971 bestseller In the Shadow of Man, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still in print. With the possible exception of Marie Curie, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist, Jane Goodall must be the most widely celebrated female scientist of the 20th century.\nIronically, her celebrity may have obscured her actual achievements. Hundreds of articles, interviews and books have told her life story but they are often limited in scope and sentimental. She has been presented as an adventure-seeking little girl, a privileged woman who dreamed of a life with wild animals, a determined feminist in a man\u2019s world, and so on. Altogether, these images devalue what she has actually done. Based on the number of references to her research by academics in her field, the number of her students who have subsequently reached influential positions in the biological sciences, and the volume of data amassed in her forty-year-long study, Jane Goodall ought to be considered a uniquely distinguished pioneer in her field and the world\u2019s leading zoologist. Yet her achievement can be stated more simply and directly: she opened the door to our understanding of the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.\nWild chimpanzees are dangerous, though before Goodall began her work the dangers were misunderstood and exaggerated. Prior to Goodall\u2019s early discoveries, no one knew that chimpanzees ate meat. We had no idea that they, or indeed any large mammals other than ourselves, created and used tools. We did not realize that chimpanzees share with humans a similar set of emotions or that their social systems are startlingly like ours. We would not have believed that chimpanzee communities across Africa possess various distinctive cultural traditions.\nGoodall\u2019s scholarly book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), ranks as the single most authoritative work in this area, the first encyclopaedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study of wild apes along the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Gombe State, Nigeria, has turned out to be, in the words of biologist Stephen Jay Gould, \u2018one of the Western world\u2019s great scientific achievements.\u2019 Jane Goodall helped create a revolution in the way we study animals, and because the animals she studied are humankind\u2019s closest relatives, she also helped alter the way humans think about themselves.\nEven as a child, there were a few early indicators of the person Jane Goodall would become. By far the clearest of these from her early childhood was in the autumn of 1939, when she was just five years old. One autumn day, a \u2018golden afternoon\u2019 as her mother remembers it, Jane disappeared. The police were called and began the search. Neighbours and family members joined in. After an increasingly frantic search, as dusk moved to dark, the child suddenly reappeared, alone, with fragments of straw in her hair and clothes. \u2018Wherever have you been?\u2019 her mother asked. Jane explained that she had wondered how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had crawled inside a henhouse, concealed herself in the straw, and lain perfectly still for five hours until the hen raised herself up, wiggled and provided an answer.

Her voices \u2013 I struggled to keep count of them all \u2013 are recognisable to viewers of children\u2019s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety. \u2018I\u2019ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,\u2019 she says, \u2018so I had to learn quickly how to pronounce loads of medical terms.\u2019\nShirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. \u2018Lots of actors, some very highly regarded, reckon they can do funny voices and, actually, many of them probably can,\u2019 she says. \u2018There\u2019s more to it than that, though. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can\u2019t see you. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many household names are desperate to do voiceover work. Thinking of the publicity, producers will invite them to auditions, but often they don\u2019t get offered parts because they\u2019re too used to acting with their whole bodies.\u2019\nAfter school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course with a standard acting career in mind. During the course, she had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. \u2018One day,\u2019 she says, \u2018the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. It seemed ridiculous \u2013 I hadn\u2019t studied drama to play rabbits \u2013 but I tried it for a laugh and, amazingly, ended up getting a major part.\u2019 Shirley realised she could do voices and that voiceover work might be the way to go. \u2018Things just happened for me,\u2019 she says. \u2018In my second film, I was lucky enough to play the main character \u2013 and her brother and mother.\u2019\nAdult female actors are frequently asked to provide the voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than those of male actors, and in the recruitment of child performers there are complex procedures and endless forms to deal with, which production companies on tight schedules would rather avoid. Shirley has learnt to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices as she watches children\u2019s TV.\nCartoons are the highlight of a job that includes a whole range of things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. \u2018Those are hard because you have to sound enthusiastic about something you care nothing about, but my years in this profession help,\u2019 she says. \u2018They\u2019ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking \u2013 that makes your voice sound bright and cheery. When I've got some days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; the interaction with other actors makes a huge difference.\u2019 \nThe competition for work is fierce, and a good showreel \u2013 a recording demonstrating what the artist can do \u2013 is essential. \u2018It\u2019s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,\u2019 Shirley says. \u2018There are agencies which specialise in helping voiceover artists put them together.\u2019 She claims to have got where she is \u2013 near the top of her profession \u2013 through doggedness as much as natural ability. \u2018Whether it\u2019s making your showreel and taking it round all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies and recording studios, or simply practising your voices, it\u2019s all about setting goals and refusing to give up.\u2019 \nFor anyone considering a career doing voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending \u2018specialist workshops \u2013 they cover all types of voiceover.\u2019 She also believes a passion for human sound is fundamental, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a sense, becoming the characters she is performing. \u2018If I\u2019ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take control of me and I\u2019ll be speaking like that for hours, perhaps even days afterwards,\u2019 she says. \u2018My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.\u2019", "level": "B2", "diff": 61.89571429, "fac": 0.617142857, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What first impressed the writer about Shirley Ford?", "answer": "d", "diff": 60.62, "disc": 0.434, "fac": 0.653, "options": {"a": {"text": "the number of her voices that seemed familiar to him", "disc": -0.16, "fac": 0.15}, "b": {"text": "the speed with which she could master new voices", "disc": -0.2, "fac": 0.09}, "c": {"text": "the ability she had to make different voices sound funny", "disc": -0.29, "fac": 0.09}, "d": {"text": "the wide range of voices she could produce", "disc": 0.43, "fac": 0.65}}}, "2": {"text": "In the second paragraph, what does Shirley say about voiceover work?", "answer": "c", "diff": 64.87, "disc": 0.302, "fac": 0.56, "options": {"a": {"text": "Many actors fail to take it seriously enough.", "disc": -0.29, "fac": 0.16}, "b": {"text": "It rarely suits actors with a background in comedy.", "disc": -0.06, "fac": 0.09}, "c": {"text": "It requires skills that well-known actors sometimes lack.", "disc": 0.3, "fac": 0.56}, "d": {"text": "Producers tend to be reluctant to consider famous actors for it.", "disc": -0.04, "fac": 0.17}}}, "3": {"text": "How does Shirley feel as she looks back on her early career?", "answer": "a", "diff": 50.81, "disc": 0.416, "fac": 0.827, "options": {"a": {"text": "grateful for the opportunities that she was given", "disc": 0.42, "fac": 0.83}, "b": {"text": "embarrassed about some of the jobs that she did", "disc": -0.44, "fac": 0.09}, "c": {"text": "sorry she took so long to discover what she was good at", "disc": -0.12, "fac": 0.01}, "d": {"text": "relieved that she avoided ending up as a conventional actor", "disc": -0.07, "fac": 0.07}}}, "4": {"text": "What can be a problem with children doing voiceover work?", "answer": "c", "diff": 69.53, "disc": 0.508, "fac": 0.453, "options": {"a": {"text": "Their voices often seem strange alongside adult voices.", "disc": -0.33, "fac": 0.11}, "b": {"text": "They tend to sound very similar to each other.", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.28}, "c": {"text": "Hiring them involves completing a lot of paperwork.", "disc": 0.51, "fac": 0.45}, "d": {"text": "It takes a long time to train them.", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.15}}}, "5": {"text": "What do we learn about Shirley from the fifth paragraph?", "answer": "b", "diff": 57.64, "disc": 0.537, "fac": 0.713, "options": {"a": {"text": "She understands that some jobs are more interesting than they might seem.

This is understandable \u2013 cartooning is one of those jobs you dream about as a little kid, like being a race car driver. But most people eventually throw these childish daydreams away and consider more realistic professions, like becoming a tax lawyer or a manufacturer of auto parts. The idea that you can support yourself financially at all, let alone maintain an adequate lifestyle, by sketching the sort of doodles commonly found in the margins of high school notebooks is, when you think about it, silly. Yet some people do exactly that.\nPeople don\u2019t become cartoonists in precisely the same way, though it\u2019s safe to say that most who do have wanted to do it for a long time. As for me, after having a fairly typical cartoonist\u2019s childhood (obsessive love of comic strips, contributions to school publications, being known throughout school as \u2018the kid who draws\u2019), I happened to study graphic design in college and then, after graduating, went around different companies with a collection of illustrations. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who told me they were looking for political cartoons on local issues. I drew up a few ideas and they bought them; in a few months, I was selling enough to support myself. \nYou actually don\u2019t need much to become a cartoonist. You don\u2019t need a university degree, you don't need much money, you don\u2019t even really need to know how to draw. You just need your brain, your hand and something that makes a mark. But of course, if it really was that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are, say, teachers. The technical barriers to being a cartoonist are low, but it\u2019s a tough job nevertheless. No one should attempt to enter the profession unless they feel that doing anything else would be impossible. After all, it\u2019s so much easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves at least a little time for the family, home repairs and hobbies.\nThe more things you know how to do well, the more chance you have of making a living with your art. I\u2019ve done political cartoons, comic strips and comic books. I\u2019ve also been a writer, a caricaturist and occasionally a designer. I don\u2019t turn down anything \u2013 that\u2019s because you can learn an awful lot even from work you don\u2019t particularly want to do. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to be intelligent, well-read and curious about everything around you. \nBut what about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when a significant number of cartoonists could find regular jobs doing cartoons for several different newspapers and magazines. But those days, if they aren\u2019t gone, are rapidly passing. For almost everyone today, cartooning is an entrepreneurial activity \u2013 that means you're not just going to have to produce the work, you're going to have to sell it. The more comfortable you are with what that involves, the better you'll do. Time and time again, I've seen cartoonists with average creative abilities and excellent business skills do far better than those who were artistic geniuses but nothing else. \nIt amazes me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon in their life and yet are terrified someone will steal their ideas. Some of these people are so worried that they refuse to let others even look at their work! Legally, all you need to do to protect your stuff is draw a little \u2018c\u2019 for \u2018copyright\u2019 somewhere, put a circle around the letter, then write your name and the date next to it. But let\u2019s face it \u2013 it's far more realistic that no one will be interested in your work. If, by some chance, someone steals a cartoon and it goes viral on the internet and everybody starts emailing it to their friends, it's not a disaster \u2013 it can be an extremely lucky break!", "level": "B2", "diff": 65.96428571, "fac": 0.532571429, "questions": {"1": {"text": "In the first paragraph, what point does the writer make about being a cartoonist?", "answer": "a", "diff": 68.68, "disc": 0.305, "fac": 0.474, "options": {"a": {"text": "It is not seen as a very practical career option.", "disc": 0.31, "fac": 0.47}, "b": {"text": "People prefer doing jobs that have a higher status.", "disc": -0.27, "fac": 0.41}, "c": {"text": "People are surprised at how little money cartoonists get.", "disc": -0.08, "fac": 0.02}, "d": {"text": "Not enough children are being encouraged to become one.", "disc": -0.02, "fac": 0.1}}}, "2": {"text": "What does \u2018that\u2019 in line 13 refer to?", "answer": "b", "diff": 79.13, "disc": 0.246, "fac": 0.247, "options": {"a": {"text": "thinking about things too much", "disc": -0.03, "fac": 0.12}, "b": {"text": "supporting yourself financially", "disc": 0.25, "fac": 0.25}, "c": {"text": "sketching doodles in school notebooks", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.43}, "d": {"text": "considering a different profession", "disc": -0.01, "fac": 0.19}}}, "3": {"text": "What is the writer doing in the second paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 50.42, "disc": 0.29, "fac": 0.844, "options": {"a": {"text": "describing a typical day in the life of a cartoonist", "disc": -0.1, "fac": 0.02}, "b": {"text": "showing how difficult he found it to live as a cartoonist", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.08}, "c": {"text": "explaining how he first got paid work as a cartoonist", "disc": 0.29, "fac": 0.84}, "d": {"text": "highlighting the education required for a cartoonist", "disc": -0.05, "fac": 0.06}}}, "4": {"text": "The writer mentions teachers to make the point that", "answer": "c", "diff": 64.33, "disc": 0.301, "fac": 0.578, "options": {"a": {"text": "professional cartoonists need time to develop their skills.", "disc": -0.24, "fac": 0.05}, "b": {"text": "professional cartoonists need to have a passion for their work.", "disc": -0.09, "fac": 0.28}, "c": {"text": "it is harder to become a professional cartoonist than it might seem.", "disc": 0.3, "fac": 0.58}, "d": {"text": "many professional cartoonists complain of not having much free time.", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.08}}}, "5": {"text": "In the fourth paragraph, the writer advises professional cartoonists to", "answer": "d", "diff": 62.65, "disc": 0.409, "fac": 0.617, "options": {"a": {"text": "learn from other types of artists.", "disc": -0.36, "fac": 0.2}, "b": {"text": "do thorough research for jobs.", "disc": -0.03, "fac": 0.05}, "c": {"text": "work on different projects at the same time.", "disc": -0.14, "fac": 0.14}, "d": {"text": "accept even unappealing jobs.", "disc": 0.41, "fac": 0.62}}}, "6": {"text": "What does the writer say about dealing with the business side of being a cartoonist?", "answer": "b", "diff": 67.05, "disc": 0.493, "fac": 0.513, "options": {"a": {"text": "It can be distracting.", "disc": -0.13, "fac": 0.1}, "b": {"text": "It is unavoidable.", "disc": 0.49, "fac": 0.51}, "c": {"text": "It is difficult to do well.", "disc": -0.2, "fac": 0.23}, "d": {"text": "It can be exhausting.", "disc": -0.31, "fac": 0.14}}}, "7": {"text": "What does the writer say about the theft of ideas from cartoonists?", "answer": "a", "diff": 69.49, "disc": 0.627, "fac": 0.455, "options": {"a": {"text": "It is highly unlikely to happen.", "disc": 0.63, "fac": 0.45}, "b": {"text": "People are more aware of it now.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.18}, "c": {"text": "The law does not prevent it happening.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.07}, "d": {"text": "The internet has made it easier to do.", "disc": -0.42, "fac": 0.29}}}}}/n{"id": 36, "title": "How my electric guitar found its way home", "text": "Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. \u2018You\u2019re not just going to throw that away, are you?\u2019 he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said \u2018Yes\u2019, and we went our separate ways.\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I\u2019d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That\u2019s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn\u2019t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: \u2018I\u2019ve got your electric guitar.\u2019\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears. I think I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was very fair. I\u2019d forgotten all about my dad\u2019s annoying habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. How Dad would have laughed to hear about this strange series of events!\nMy mum and dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar: it was the 1970s and classical guitarists were very popular. I loved the sound of the instrument: so calming, so gentle \u2013 and so flattering to the learner. Unlike the violin, it didn\u2019t sound awful in the hands of a beginner. But the truth was, I couldn\u2019t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. This was not just the era of the classical guitar; it was also the time of punk music, when people who  weren\u2019t able to play their instruments well could be rock stars.\nWhen I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith had sent to me, I had a sudden, vivid memory of my birthday, back in 1978, when my smiling parents presented the instrument to me. Picking it up again, it felt so fascinatingly smooth, dense, yet smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then instantly felt the need to stand up, putting a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar demands to be played in this position. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn\u2019t have drawn a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it. My middle-aged, fleshy fingertips felt that special pain of holding down the wires to play a chord.\nThe electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I\u2019m learning it again, I guess I\u2019ll have to form a band. My son\u2019s learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine.

When I wrote the book Insomniac, about people who suffer from sleeplessness, I felt like a lone voice warning of the dangers of sleep-deprivation, and the impact sleep loss has on our minds, bodies, and moods. As any insomniac will tell you (and I interviewed dozens), there\u2019s nothing so crucial as sleep for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems those who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. So it\u2019s great that sleep is getting this long overdue attention. But I\u2019m wondering, what about dreams? I haven\u2019t heard much about dreams in the discussion.\nWe\u2019re losing dreams all the time. When you wake to an early alarm, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, the sleep you sacrifice is mainly REM or \u2018Rapid Eye Movement\u2019, the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Our most vivid, memorable and emotionally powerful dreams occur mainly in the stage of REM just before we wake up in the morning. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of sleep time in REM, so a person who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers deprive people of REM, there is an increase in amount and intensity of REM to compensate the following night. So it seems dreams are there for something.\nWhen researchers discovered REM in 1953, most agreed with the great psychologist Sigmund Freud, who had argued that interpreting dreams was the best way of understanding the way our mind works. It didn\u2019t turn out to be that simple, of course. Subsequent findings about the workings of the brain did not support this belief. The focus of dream study shifted to the physical rather than psychological origins of dreams. At present, there is \u2018precious little on which dream researchers agree,\u2019 says Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold.\nDreams are important. At an annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel of the University of Colorado Medical School described a study that found a much better ability to remember and use dreams among actors, writers, and directors than among participants at his sleep center. Dream use increases, he concludes, in proportion to a person\u2019s interest in the creative process. It makes sense that filmmakers have an important relationship with their dreams, since film is, of all human creations, probably the most dream-like. But I came away from Pagel\u2019s talk thinking, are artistic types the only ones who have a use for their dreams? Doesn\u2019t everybody \u2013 teachers and software designers and politicians \u2013 need to think creatively?\nDreams, Stickgold says, are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways, drawing on stores of knowledge from the past and present to find new associations. Dreams may help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking. For example, Stickgold has found that when people are awakened out of REM and asked to say what comes to their minds in response to a certain word, their responses are more original than when awoken from other stages of sleep. They \u2018ignore the obvious and put together things that make a kind of crazy unexpected kind of sense ... This is what creativity is,\u2019 says Stickgold.\nI certainly write better when I awake out of intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to provide some kind of fluency, fuel for thought. Those are the days that the words and images tumble out so fast that my fingers on the keys can barely keep up. I don\u2019t know how it works, but it does seem to work.

But as you walk into her studio with its incredible sea view, you pass a number of empty frames hanging on the walls, between smiling photographs of her two daughters. For a pioneer of the copyist art movement, able to reproduce the richness of an early-20th century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait, it seems a strange oversight.\n\u2018I don\u2019t have any of my own knocking around,\u2019 says Susie with a shrug. \u2018As soon as I finish them, they go.\u2019 The problem is that Susie\u2019s in great demand. During her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted the works of numerous great artists: Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh among them. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals. While the originals would fetch millions of pounds in auctions, her reproductions fetch anything between a few hundred pounds and \u00a312,000, as determined by how long she spends on them.\nSusie won\u2019t name most of her clients, even when pushed, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors are genuine art lovers, status is often a factor. One celebrity buyer loves to boast about his \u2018Van Gogh\u2019 painting, when it\u2019s really a \u2018Susie Ray Van Gogh\u2019. \u2018Actually, many famous people pass off my copies as originals,\u2019 she says. \u2018That\u2019s up to them.\u2019 Some collectors save on house insurance by storing the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie\u2019s copy.\nSusie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible \u2013 she believes doing it badly would be letting the artist down. But she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as the real thing is against the law, and although she knows people who have made money that way, it\u2019s why she has never been tempted. The makers of fakes tend to end up in trouble, one way or another. She points out that she isn\u2019t rich and has struggled at times. However, her situation is more secure now and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to put her reputation among collectors and artists at risk.\nSusie hasn\u2019t always been a copyist. After her art degree, she was hired as an illustrator by a botanical garden. For several years she worked for a pittance. Looking back she can see it was good grounding for what she does now, and it gave her a passion for plants, although it was barely enough to survive on. She tells me she had to be incredibly accurate, and that it was important to get things right first time. She has no regrets about having done it, but she\u2019s glad she eventually found something more rewarding financially.\nWhen younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she\u2019s studied to be able to do what she does. Her approach has equipped her to do anything from drawing plants to making perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art, though she now specialises in the French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne and Degas her favourites. Susie also says there\u2019s an assumption that more modern art is straightforward \u2013 kid\u2019s stuff almost. The impressionists, for instance, painted quickly and freely. In Susie\u2019s experience, what people fail to realise is the impressionists were also meticulous, and that combination is tougher than anything else to get right.\nGiven her skills, it seems odd that Susie doesn\u2019t do her own stuff. Isn\u2019t art about expressing yourself? And might a Susie Ray original earn more than a Susie Ray copy? She says what she does is the result of years of training and application \u2013 and she makes a good living from it. She has occasionally tried her own thing. She once attempted oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up just looking like photographs \u2013 OK, but no better than that. Perhaps it\u2019s like surviving on bread and water after a lifetime of food cooked by a top chef.

It was her great obsession from childhood. With the boats that took her round the world, she had a kind of strange union. They worked as one. And when she was on land again, everyday life felt trivial, everyone pressed in too much to find out about the race, and she soon wanted to be out on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature even in places that had nearly destroyed her.\nAfter she came second in the Vend\u00e9e Globe non stop, solo round-the-world race several years ago, she took me down into the tiny, unventilated cabin of her boat Kingfisher on a \u2018tour\u2019 of what had been her cell, home, work station and survival-capsule for 94 days. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning; how she worked out, to the last sheet, exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was everything, she said. Proudly, she showed off her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, the tiny gas stove, the neatly hanging polythene bags of medical necessities and rations. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. \nNow, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, a desolate island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. \u2018It made me stop and think. It gave me space \u2026 to see things differently; to realise things I hadn\u2019t let into my head before.\u2019 The sight of so many abandoned whaling stations struck her as a warning. \u2018It seemed as though we had just taken what we wanted and moved on. That\u2019s what we do.\u2019\nWhen I arrive at Ellen\u2019s office she is just finishing off a heated conference call. Then she explains to me why action must be taken now to save the planet. \u2018No one is making coal or oil or gas any more. They are a precious asset we have just once. We have to design a way of not using things up. At first, my message was negative \u2013 use less \u2013 but gradually I realised there was another way of looking at things.\u2019 Now she emphasises re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.\n For the last three years, she has been touring factories, mines and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. \u2018I will never be an expert,\u2019 she says. \u2018But I am a bit like a sponge. I love soaking things up. [The current situation] became something I just couldn\u2019t ignore. Sailing, by comparison, seemed incredibly selfish. This is different. It\u2019s about trying to find out how my voice can be the most useful. It really matters.\u2019\nShe also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. \u2018I do miss the adventure that comes from being at sea,\u2019 she says. \u2018It is what makes me, me. You are so connected to everything around you. You have no time to get lonely. You are focused on the record, on practicalities, on survival. [My new] message will never be as straightforward as saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to be the fastest person round the world.\u201d I may have been the fastest round the world, but this beats everything I\u2019ve ever done.\u2019", "level": "B2", "diff": 60.185, "fac": 0.6965, "questions": {"1": {"text": "Whenever Ellen MacArthur came back after a long time at sea, she used to", "answer": "d", "diff": 57.52, "disc": 0.454, "fac": 0.765, "options": {"a": {"text": "feel grateful for having survived the journey.

If he makes it, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation.  Because young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, he hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains.  Or, at least, to venture outdoors.\nJordan\u2019s team for the climb includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen.  \u2018Team Romero\u2019 they call themselves, and climbing Everest is only part of their goal.  If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits, the highest points on each continent.  Few people achieve this under the age of thirty.  Jordan has already climbed five of them and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.\nI have spoken to a number of well-known Everest climbers and could not find a single one who thought that taking a 13-year-old up the world\u2019s highest mountain was a good idea.  They agreed that a young climber might have the necessary physical strength, but had doubts about whether a teenager would be emotionally strong enough.  In addition, they couldn\u2019t see how a young person could have gained enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely.\nThe Romeros have heard such views before.  \u2018I know that criticism is out there,\u2019 Paul says, \u2018but I can\u2019t waste my time with it \u2013 there\u2019s still so much to do.  I think about possible problems, obviously.  Karen and I weigh up the risks all the time, but we believe our own experience as climbers will help.  And watching Jordan develop gives me confidence.  He\u2019s becoming so strong and grown-up.\u2019\nI also wonder about Jordan\u2019s motivation.  Is this just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme?  \u2018This project isn\u2019t about me trying to become famous for my son\u2019s achievements,\u2019 Paul insists.  \u2018At first, he talked about it as something to do later in life, but when we discussed it, we thought: \u2018Why not now?\u2019  We talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn\u2019t lost the motivation to do it.\u2019  When I ask Jordan what pleasure he finds in the challenge he says, \u2018I just focus on achieving my goal.\u2019\nIn the past, few knew or cared about being the youngest or fastest person to climb a particular mountain, or sail a particular ocean.  Today, every adventure is blogged about, and every climb turns into a record-setting challenge.  The more adventurous the record, the more interest it generates.  This gives Jordan a dilemma.

Most of us can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and you can tell by the expression on their face that they haven\u2019t a clue.  I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age.  And if you don\u2019t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work.\nThe statistics must be depressing for a lover of classical music.  Apparently only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere 300 copies.  I must say I still find that hard to believe.  So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries?  The older generation are irritated by our obsession with TV and video games, blaming it for most things, but I don\u2019t think there is any connection in this case.  The simple truth is that classical music just doesn\u2019t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets.\nNow, I\u2019m aware that this doesn\u2019t apply to everyone my age.  I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts all the time, but they are a minority.  Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I\u2019m not exactly a classical music fan.  I enjoy a huge range of styles, but judging by what\u2019s stored on my computer, my classical music consumption is probably pretty close to that 3% figure.\nSo why don\u2019t teenagers like classical music?  Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its numerous changes of mood, are problematic for us.  We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast.  In addition, if you believe the experts, we have difficulty paying attention for more than about three minutes; far too short for most pieces of classical music, but perfect for a pop song.  Pop is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to, while appreciating a piece of classical music requires time and concentration.  The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics.  Classical music is incredibly powerful, but not exactly full of the issues that concern teenagers.\nThe way we listen to music has also changed.  In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and an ability to play an instrument was highly valued.  The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert.  Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.  When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing in the background?\nOne of my teachers claims that audiences at classical concerts have actually increased in recent years.  Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers.  In my orchestra we play classical music in all sorts of different places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see virtually nothing but grey hair when I look into the crowd.  I don\u2019t know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if you\u2019re a teenager and your mum and dad love something, the chances are you\u2019ll do your best to stay away from it.\nSome say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra.  They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse.  Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice.  The two activities have become separated.  When we want to relax, it\u2019s always pop music.", "level": "B2", "diff": 58.79142857, "fac": 0.672857143, "questions": {"1": {"text": "In the first paragraph, what does the writer say about teenagers?", "answer": "c", "diff": 51.35, "disc": 0.355, "fac": 0.829, "options": {"a": {"text": "Their knowledge of classical music is limited to the names of composers.", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.12}, "b": {"text": "They don\u2019t listen to classical music because they don\u2019t know what to buy.", "disc": -0.07, "fac": 0.03}, "c": {"text": "Even the ones who study music have limited knowledge of classical music.", "disc": 0.35, "fac": 0.83}, "d": {"text": "Some would be embarrassed to admit to having classical music on their MP3 player.", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.02}}}, "2": {"text": "How does the writer feel about the statistics she mentions in the second paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 70.64, "disc": 0.433, "fac": 0.427, "options": {"a": {"text": "disappointed that people are losing interest in classical music", "disc": -0.3, "fac": 0.36}, "b": {"text": "annoyed that older people criticise the things that she enjoys", "disc": -0.08, "fac": 0.07}, "c": {"text": "surprised that so few people buy classical music recordings", "disc": 0.43, "fac": 0.43}, "d": {"text": "certain that the future of classical music depends on teenagers", "disc": -0.14, "fac": 0.15}}}, "3": {"text": "What is the meaning of \u2018classical music consumption\u2019 in lines 33 and 34 ?

Her mother was getting out of the other door at the time, so didn\u2019t overhear, but Bonnie wouldn\u2019t have cared if she had.  Her mother knew her feelings.  Mrs. Wyndham looked about her.  Almonside was a funny school, all bits and pieces, buildings hidden away amongst the trees on a wooded hillside; very confusing at first sight.  Then she saw the signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre\u2026\n\u2018Riding centre,\u2019 said Bonnie, showing a sudden interest.\n\u2018Headmaster\u2019s study,\u2019 said her mother. \u2018This way.\u2019\nBonnie followed her mother along a broad drive that curved between trees.\n\u2018I wish you\u2019d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,\u2019 said Mrs. Wyndham wearily, but she didn\u2019t seem to expect Bonnie to do so.\nA few minutes later her mother was talking to Bonnie\u2019s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie herself sat and waited outside the door.  Suddenly Bonnie jumped up.  \u2018Why should I just sit here?\u2019 she said to herself.  \u2018I\u2019ll be thrown out before very long, anyway,\u2019 she said mentally to the door, \u2018so why not get it over and done with?\u2019  She left the building and headed for the riding centre in the direction indicated by the sign.\nThere was a nice old building where the horses were kept, and a large structure for indoor riding.  Bonnie looked about her, but there was no-one in sight.  There was a certain reverence about her manner as she approached the animals.  Bonnie treated horses with respect.  The horses were very well looked after, she could tell that at once.Almost every stall was occupied, and she wandered along looking carefully at each horse and judging it.  \u2018I know what they\u2019re doing here,\u2019 she told a small pony as she ran a finger along its nose. It was the next horse that pulled her up short.  \u2018But aren\u2019t you the best of the lot!\u2019 she said.  He was brown with a touch of white.  Lively, probably, but Bonnie liked that.  \u2018You know, I have the feeling we\u2019ve met before,\u2019 said Bonnie, stroking his neck.  \u2018It was in my dreams and I was riding you to victory in some big competition\u2026\u2019  Over the stall was his name: Maverick.\nSuddenly, she couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to ride the horse.  \u2018I wonder where I can find a bridle for your head, and a saddle for your back.  Can\u2019t be far away.\u2019  The room containing all the riding equipment was \u2013 Bonnie was delighted to discover \u2013 unlocked.  Absorbed in the pleasurable task of putting a saddle on Maverick\u2019s back, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster.  When she sat up high on the big horse outside the building, she felt like a queen, mistress of all she could see.  Her nickname at her previous school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed delightedly as she remembered it.  \u2018You\u2019re the best horse I\u2019ve ever sat on, Maverick,\u2019 she said admiringly, \u2018and when I say that I\u2019m not kidding, I can assure you, because I know about horses, even if I don\u2019t know about anything else.\u2019\nShe nudged him into a walk, then into a trot.  \u2018If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,\u2019 she confided.  She went round and round the paddock.  The rhythm was exhilarating, a little breeze whipping smartly past her cheek and making it glow.

The 15-year-old Australian has already released a number of very successful songs.  So how did a laid-back surfer guy end up on a stage in front of thousands and thousands of fans?  \u2018I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,\u2019 Cody says, recalling how it all began. `But you know I was swimming every day, and I was surfing. Those were the things that meant more to me back then; I had my life set up and so much to occupy my time.  I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online.\u2019  These videos changed everything.  He began with a posting of a friend and himself singing at a school concert. Fans sent in online comments saying they wanted more of his videos to appear on their social networking sights. So Cody, who\u2019d recorded some more at home, was happy to oblige. The responses to them were overwhelming.\nCody was a very talented swimmer.  He was training hard with some of the best coaches and putting his focus into perfecting his sport.  But then record labels came calling, and he had a tough choice to make: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a huge risk by signing a deal and moving with his entire family to the US. Cody resolved to take the plunge.  \u2018It was very difficult for me \u2013 especially at such a young age \u2013 to have to choose a career for myself.  Can you imagine, at 12 or 13 years old trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?\u2019\nHe had to break the news to his swimming coach \u2013 as well as to his friends \u2013 that he was moving to the States.  \u2018It came as a big surprise to most people.  I\u2019m kind of the quiet kid,\u2019 he says, remembering their shocked expressions after hearing the news.  \u2018I\u2019m very modest, and I think it\u2019s important to be that way in this crazy work.\u2019  So Cody packed his bags and went with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream in the hope of making another one come true.  And although his family keep out of the spotlight and aren\u2019t directly involved in his career, they are there in the background.

A fresh crack in the ice glistened in the morning sunlight.  I shaded my eyes and looked upstream towards the wall of sandbags, there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted.  My back still ached from lifting them into place.  All last week, I\u2019d worked alongside most of the town\u2019s adult population for long hours, proving I was up to the task.  Not that my grandfather took much notice.\nWith one hand still on the curtain, I swept my eyes along the half-mile ribbon of steaming black water formed by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown.  With fragile ice shelves on either side, the dark open patch was followed by solid ice downstream.  As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I spotted a boy on the far side of the river\u2019s edge.  A boy I didn\u2019t recognise.  I frowned.  Unbelievably, he was attempting to balance on an ice shelf along the water warmed by the factory.  I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket.  I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there \u2013 a silver chain my famous grandfather once brought back from an expedition in South America.  Far better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which no one but him, my mom and me know about.  Plus, I have the actual diary that he kept on that journey.  I keep it under my pillow and read bits of it before I fall asleep.  I patted the chain again and made my way towards the kitchen.\n\u2018Morning, Rex.\u2019  Mom smiled at me as I grabbed a banana off the kitchen counter.  \u2018You\u2019re up early for a Saturday.  I\u2019ll cook up brunch after your training session.  Be careful, now.\u2019  \u2018Thanks, Mom.\u2019  I headed down the hallway, nearly slamming into Grandpa\u2019s tall thin frame as he stepped out\nof his bedroom.  \u2018Can\u2019t you ever watch where you\u2019re going?\u2019 he shouted.  \u2018Where are you going, anyway?\u2019  \u2018Sorry, Grandpa.  I\u2019m going kayaking.\u2019  As if my wetsuit didn\u2019t make that obvious.  As if he didn\u2019t see me in my kayak every morning.  Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he loses his temper, but he\u2019s been making it that much harder for me to do lately.\n\u2018What\u2019s the point of training?  You didn\u2019t win the competition,\u2019 he said.  For a split second, the steel-edged remark hit exactly like he meant it to.  But I took a deep breath and silently counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door shut behind him.  Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile.  \u2018Don\u2019t mind him.  He\u2019s\u2026\u2019  \u2018\u2026not himself at the moment,\u2019 I finished for her.  I refrained from saying that he\u2019d always been that way.  But, like Mom, I try to go easy on him.\nWhen I was a child, he was my hero \u2013 from the time he first showed me photos of him in the National Geographic magazine.  Those faded photos still hang framed on his bedroom wall, above his dust-covered expedition medals and trophies.  But I don\u2019t go into his room anymore.  I\u2019ve got my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, someday soon, maybe, my own face in National Geographic.  And yet, well, a part of me still wants to remain devoted to him, this ill-tempered old man.\nMom smiled.  \u2018At least, he\u2019s coming out of his bedroom more.  Have a good session, Rex.  I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!\u2019  I smiled back at her as I peeled my banana.  \u2018It\u2019ll be warmer in South America,\u2019 I said.  \u2018If I come up with sponsors for my expedition.\u2019  She laughed and returned to the kitchen.

Jess followed her through to the study and there on the table, propped against the wall, was an unframed painting, unmistakably one of Grandpa\u2019s, yet unlike anything he had done before, and clearly nowhere near finished.  \u2018Do you know anything about this?\u2019 said Mum.  Jess shook her head.  \u2018I\u2019ve never seen it before.  I didn\u2019t know he was working on anything.\u2019\nJess stared at the picture.  There was a river that dominated the scene; not a river she recognized and perhaps not even a real one at all, just a fantasy river.  The picture was strange and amorphous \u2013 and beautiful in an eerie way.  The riverbank was almost insignificant, such a subtle hint of green that the eye barely took it in, being somehow drawn into the pale waters and away towards a hidden sea.  There were no animals, no birds, no people; and it felt right that way.  There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision.  Yet for some reason, she was captivated, thinking of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer.\nMum spoke again.  \u2018It\u2019s got a name.\u2019  There was something in her voice \u2013 something too casual, too detached \u2013 that betrayed her enthusiasm.  And Jess knew why.  Grandpa never gave his pictures names.   He just painted them and left others to make sense of them, if they could.  Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had scrawled there.  Jess read them aloud.  \u2018River Boy.\u2019  The words seemed to carry a strange resonance, as though they were somehow important to her, yet why that should be so she could not tell.  And there was a further mystery.  She looked round at Mum.  \u2018There is no boy.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly.  Strange, isn\u2019t it \u2013 I mean, for him to be so specific.  Still, he hasn\u2019t finished it yet, so maybe he\u2019s going to put the boy in later.  I made the mistake of asking him about it.\u2019  \u2018Mum!  You should have known better.\u2019  \u2018I know, but I couldn\u2019t resist it.  It\u2019s such an unusual picture, especially having a name.  I suppose you can guess the response.\u2019  Jess didn\u2019t need to guess.  She knew what Grandpa\u2019s response would have been.  \u2018He told you it\u2019s not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and its own language, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don\u2019t.  And he said painting\u2019s hard enough work as it is without having to waste time telling every idiot \u2026\u2019  \u2018Ignoramus, he said.\u2019  \u2018\u2026 every ignoramus what the thing means.  And if artists had to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along, they\u2019d never get any work done.  And he said \u2026\u2019.  Mum interrupted her, laughing.  \u2018Something like that.  Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, seeing as you seem to be a sort of muse for him.\u2019  \u2018Muse?\u2019  \u2018Someone who inspires an artist.\u2019\nShe knew what the word meant.  Grandpa had often used it when she went to watch him paint, but, generally, it was just to say that the muse wasn\u2019t being kind to him today, or that he\u2019d have to be nice to the muse today as he had a difficult bit to work on, or something like that.  He\u2019d never suggested the muse had anything to do with her.  Indeed, she\u2019d always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being at all.  And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, having any influence over someone as wilful as Grandpa.  \u2018He doesn\u2019t need me to inspire him,\u2019 she said.  \u2018He\u2019s been painting all his life.\u2019", "level": "B2", "diff": 66.28875, "fac": 0.5, "questions": {"1": {"text": "How did Jess feel when her mother first showed her the painting?", "answer": "b", "diff": 62.43, "disc": 0.322, "fac": 0.587, "options": {"a": {"text": "disappointed to see that it was still unfinished", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.09}, "b": {"text": "surprised at the style in which it was painted", "disc": 0.32, "fac": 0.59}, "c": {"text": "unsure whether her grandfather had painted it", "disc": -0.14, "fac": 0.28}, "d": {"text": "guilty about keeping it a secret from her mother", "disc": -0.14, "fac": 0.04}}}, "2": {"text": "The word \u2018eerie\u2019 in line 14 is used to suggest that the painting", "answer": "b", "diff": 57.64, "disc": 0.247, "fac": 0.693, "options": {"a": {"text": "presented an artificial image.", "disc": -0.12, "fac": 0.09}, "b": {"text": "had a mysterious feel about it.", "disc": 0.25, "fac": 0.69}, "c": {"text": "was depressing to look at.", "disc": -0.05, "fac": 0.01}, "d": {"text": "created a confusing impression.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.2}}}, "3": {"text": "What does \u2018barely took it in\u2019 mean in line 16 ?", "answer": "a", "diff": 67.19, "disc": 0.227, "fac": 0.473, "options": {"a": {"text": "hardly realised it was there", "disc": 0.23, "fac": 0.47}, "b": {"text": "felt almost unable to look at it", "disc": -0.19, "fac": 0.06}, "c": {"text": "avoided focusing on it for long", "disc": -0.13, "fac": 0.16}, "d": {"text": "found it nearly impossible to see", "disc": -0.04, "fac": 0.31}}}, "4": {"text": "When Jess stared at the picture, what was her reaction to it?", "answer": "d", "diff": 58.89, "disc": 0.456, "fac": 0.667, "options": {"a": {"text": "She was pleased by the memories it brought back.", "disc": -0.31, "fac": 0.15}, "b": {"text": "She was troubled by the way it made her feel.", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.1}, "c": {"text": "She wished it were a little livelier.", "disc": -0.13, "fac": 0.08}, "d": {"text": "She became deeply absorbed in it.", "disc": 0.46, "fac": 0.67}}}, "5": {"text": "According to the third paragraph, Jess became aware that", "answer": "d", "diff": 76.26, "disc": 0.289, "fac": 0.273, "options": {"a": {"text": "her grandfather had played a trick on them.", "disc": -0.1, "fac": 0.06}, "b": {"text": "her mother was unaffected by what they had discovered.", "disc": -0.13, "fac": 0.1}, "c": {"text": "her grandfather had left them a message about the picture.", "disc": -0.13, "fac": 0.57}, "d": {"text": "her mother was trying to hide the way she felt.", "disc": 0.29, "fac": 0.27}}}, "6": {"text": "When Jess says, \u2018You should have known better\u2019 (lines 41 and 42), she means that her mother", "answer": "c", "diff": 60.41, "disc": 0.34, "fac": 0.633, "options": {"a": {"text": "should have realised why there was no boy in the picture.", "disc": -0.26, "fac": 0.25}, "b": {"text": "should not have pointed out that there was a problem with the picture.", "disc": -0.07, "fac": 0.09}, "c": {"text": "should not have questioned her grandfather about the picture.", "disc": 0.34, "fac": 0.63}, "d": {"text": "should have waited for Jess to talk to her grandfather.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.02}}}, "7": {"text": "What do we learn about Jess and her mother in the fourth paragraph?", "answer": "b", "diff": 80.01, "disc": 0.344, "fac": 0.207, "options": {"a": {"text": "Jess\u2019s mother is pleased that Jess is so interested in her grandfather\u2019s art.", "disc": 0.0, "fac": 0.38}, "b": {"text": "Jess feels comfortable discussing her grandfather with her mother.", "disc": 0.34, "fac": 0.21}, "c": {"text": "Jess believes her mother knows her grandfather better than she does.", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.33}, "d": {"text": "Jess\u2019s mother thinks Jess should have more respect for her grandfather.", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.08}}}, "8": {"text": "What impression is given of Jess\u2019s grandfather in the final paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 67.48, "disc": 0.359, "fac": 0.467, "options": {"a": {"text": "He lacks confidence in his ability.", "disc": -0.23, "fac": 0.27}, "b": {"text": "He values Jess\u2019s opinions.", "disc": -0.02, "fac": 0.2}, "c": {"text": "He has a strong character.", "disc": 0.36, "fac": 0.47}, "d": {"text": "He finds it hard to concentrate.", "disc": -0.27, "fac": 0.06}}}}}/n{"id": 46, "title": "My Tiny Bedroom", "text": "When I woke up this morning, I didn\u2019t mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet.  Not that I\u2019m claiming it was an accident, exactly, though it could have been.  Like if I\u2019d tripped over the edge of the bed, for instance, with Dad\u2019s Stanley knife clutched in my hand, the blade might well have gone plunging into the carpet all by itself and carved a huge great chunk out of it.  I mean, that is what could quite easily have happened.  I\u2019m not saying that it did, just that it could have. \nAll I\u2019m saying is, I didn\u2019t mean to damage the carpet.  It wasn\u2019t like I woke up in the morning and thought, \u2018Today I shall cut a hole in my carpet.\u2019  It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do.  Then afterwards you wonder why you thought that, only by then it\u2019s too late.  This is something that happens to me rather a lot.  I\u2019m very unfortunate in that way. \nWhat I was doing, in actual fact, wasn\u2019t thinking about cutting holes so much as trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner.  Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat.  It\u2019s really cute!  Very small and painted white, with pink and blue flowers all running round the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors.  Gran used to keep china ornaments in there:  shepherdesses and milkmaids and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons.  I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.  Gran knew I\u2019d always loved her corner cabinet.  I was so excited when she gave it to me!  But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet.  That is why it is shaped like a triangle.  It has to stand in a corner. \nI\u2019ve only got two corners in my bedroom.  This is because it\u2019s the smallest room in the house, tucked away under the roof, and is shaped like a wedge of cheese.  The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad\u2019s; the one at the back is my sister Angela\u2019s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom\u2019s; and the one the size of a broom cupboard belongs to me.  Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his.  And when Tom goes to University, I can take my pick.  But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems to me I\u2019m going to be stuck in my broom cupboard for years to come.  I don\u2019t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom.  It\u2019s cosy, like a nest.  And I love the way the roof slopes down, and the way the window is at floor level.  \nThe only problem is, the lack of corners!  My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.  I\u2019d tried fitting Gran\u2019s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall.  If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...  That was when it came to me.

When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I realised it was going to be hard to live up to people\u2019s expectations. Those who love the book have very definite ideas about how everything should be. I relied heavily on the original drawings from the book because I didn't want to be chased down the street by people telling me I'd got it all wrong. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex. \nThe most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we were filming the Borrowers nervously walking across a room or bravely setting out on one of their borrowing missions, we had to be 10 times further away than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres, in order to get the Borrowers' perspective; they got through so many pairs of jeans between them! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right when the images of the supposedly tiny Borrowers were combined with a background image of ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called and asked how I'd done it.\nThe only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards of the house, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry around things such as a giant pair of scissors, they really entered into the spirit of \t\tit. I particularly remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and difficult to lift. We\u2019d often have to stop shooting because they made the crew laugh so much. But in the story there\u2019s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with the hoses and said the experience was so frightening, they didn\u2019t have to act at all. \nOne of the things that was important to me, and which directors have struggled with in other TV versions, was getting the costumes right. I had them made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls\u2019 clothes do. This made it nearly impossible for the leading actress to bend in her costume.  She couldn\u2019t sit down during breaks in filming, and she couldn\u2019t even take the dress off as she had to be sewn into it every morning. The trousers worn by the lead actor were made from a rug, as normal trouser material would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don\u2019t think either of them thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!\nMost of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers\u2019 home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren't physically there. I had to draw pictures of every scene myself to show people how each one should look \u2013 I\u2019d done 2,000 of them by the end. They weren\u2019t accurate in any way, but they worked well enough. The budget wouldn\u2019t stretch to having time in special effects studios during the day, so I spent three months working nights.  We had to work hard and fast \u2013 I once shot a whole scene before realising there was no film in the camera.

But this is what I asked her for. To get away from my old life on the road and tour tutors. So while the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we\u2019re staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet real kids for a change. How about a kid with a mother who types from nine to five in an office? Or a dad who cuts grass?

Nobody will ever suspect me now! \n\u2018Nice shoes,\u2019 she whispers. \nI look down at my expensive platforms with the tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn\u2019t have worn these.

McGraw?\u2019 she says hesitantly. \n\u2018Here.\u2019\nThe teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines.

Or the real reason, according to Dad? \u2018We need a change, Desert,\u2019 he said, \u2018and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just the essence our last album desperately needed.\u2019 Essence? Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach.

That's being an American teenager today. Teenage boys and girls can't simply go to school and blend into the background, because average is no longer enough. Mediocrity isn't acceptable and a lack of excessive ambition is considered laziness.\n\u2018People, often adults, forget how much pressure that teenagers have these days. We have piles of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores and responsibilities at home, all in addition to trying to maintain some sort of social life,\u2019 teenager Kristen Loose says. Despite these stresses being the norm in teenage life today, the negative stereotypes of teenagers still exist, often perpetuated by people in the media. You know what I mean: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless and self-absorbed. While there is evidence that they do exist, lumping the entire generation into such a category is not considered fair by some. \u2018A lot of people would assume that we spend the majority of our time with our eyes glued to the television and our hands glued to our cell phones,\u2019 Loose says.\nLoose believes this assumption is largely incorrect. She admits to having her cellphone within a few feet at most times of the day, but not for frivolous purposes. It isn't just a means of texting her friends; it is a tool that teens have embraced to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. It is expected that students today have immediate access to the world and that they be reachable at all times, hence creating what appears to be a cell phone addiction. \nWith the introduction of smart phones, tablets and social media, students can now take their work on the go with them, and do their homework wherever they happen to be. Instead of listening to music on\t\tthe drive to school, they could be listening to downloaded language lessons. In essence, schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate, but now require 24-hour attention from already overworked teens. \nMany teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after school activities, family obligations and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation polled American teenagers and found that about 20 percent of all teens get the recommended nine hours a night. Moreover, 28 percent of teens polled admitted falling asleep in school about once a week, because of sleep deprivation.\nTeenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all of her other activities are accounted for, she gets about 18 hours of leisure time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is anything but impressive. And Olsen rarely wastes those hours on social media or television.

Over the last few years, this isolated group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, around 35 km above the Earth's surface. It's a long-running science project but with a bit of a twist: it\u2019s part astronomy experiment, part backcountry adventure, which is possibly why teenagers get involved. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or piece of metal travelling through space enters the earth's atmosphere, producing a trail of light.\nAs it gets dark, the teenagers secure a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude and a thermometer to gauge the changes along the ascent. Two GPS trackers are mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group to find it later. A gas tank, donated by an enthusiast in a neighbouring state, is used to inflate the balloon, which slowly grows to the size of a small car. An older boy had made a seven-hour round trip to get hold of it. \u2018I didn\u2019t really mind,\u2019 he says. Anyway, for kids in this club, that\u2019s a given.\nFinally, it's time for lift-off.  \u2018Five, four, three, two, one,\u2019 they chant, and the balloon begins its ascent. Some of them run and track its path with powerful flashlights for as long as they are able, illuminating the creamy orb in the moonless sky. There is quiet, and a palpable sense of collective wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night.\nWhen the launch is over, most of the students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside and gaze at a sky so breathtakingly clear, it's hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles, a crowded and bustling metropolis of around 4 million people.\nI watch a boy climb into a sleeping bag and promptly fall asleep. \u2018We're the only ones talking,\u2019 says one girl in hushed tones. \u2018I know,\u2019 whispers another. A meteor shoots across the middle of the sky.\nAs a balloon rises, the air pressure lessens and the balloon expands until it's almost the size of a house. Then it pops in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the following day, using the GPS trackers as a guide. Getting it back isn\u2019t straightforward, but that\u2019s part of the appeal. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box almost always lands somewhere in the middle of nowhere. \u2018To me, recoveries are a huge part of the program,\u2019 said the group\u2019s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. \u2018Part of the journey has been becoming more familiar with this landscape in a way you never normally would.\u2019\nOn this occasion, the lunch box had landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get to it, the recovery team would have to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountain range. Then they'd have to agree whether driving or walking would be preferable \u2013 things could turn treacherous if the lunch box was on a high peak, or even worse, up a very tall tree. \u2018It's important to keep in mind that these students are native to the Eastern Sierra,\u2019 their leader says. \u2018What may seem wild and perilous to some, is simply a way of life to others.\u2019 \nIn the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.

Even then, it happened more by accident than design. \u2018My younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase that\u2019s so common among children, and which I hadn\u2019t experienced. In fact, I tended to dismiss it. I reluctantly lent him a hand with a science project, and when I came across an article about some of the recent discoveries in the field, it just blew my mind. I knew immediately that this was something I wanted to commit myself to.\u2019 \nI am curious to know what encouragement she got because Palaeontology was by no means a common career choice for young people at that time. \u2018I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,\u2019 she laughs. \u2018This guy, Matt Cornelius, was famous already, despite being quite young. At first I was a nervous wreck, even though he had a reputation for being approachable and easy-going. I was still worried he\u2019d think I was just an annoying kid pestering him with my questions. The whole thing could easily have been awkward and embarrassing,\u2019 Chloe tells me. \u2018But I felt more at ease when he showed so much patience and willingness to listen.\u2019 \nI cannot resist bringing up the question of the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowns for a moment. \u2018I have to admit that films such as Jurassic Park featuring dinosaurs created by special effects technology have led to a huge surge in public interest in these creatures, though not necessarily in Palaeontology more generally. However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading. What irritates me is that we're either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or rather geeky losers, figures of fun who don\u2019t know how to relate to people. And films fail to represent accurately the everyday reality of our working lives.\u2019 I ask her to explain.\n\u2018My job is remarkably varied. I spend lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also have to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications.\u2019 \nWhile it's not necessarily something Chloe is required to do on a daily basis, there\u2019s also the question of communicating scientific findings to the public, if time allows. The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. \u2018There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don\u2019t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it\u2019s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.\u2019 \nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. \u2018I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period. We succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because we\u2019ve learned such a tremendous amount about dinosaurs recently and the ones which are depicted in this programme are radically different to those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are easily the most life-like that have ever been portrayed.\u2019 \nWhy does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain the focus of ongoing research?  \u2018I suspect that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered.

It\u2019s \u2019here\u2019. So if you really think there\u2019s a chance that you\u2019re \u2018there\u2019 yet, you should be asking \u2019Are we here yet? \u2019 And I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no one who wishes they were \u2018there yet\u2019 more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.\nI mean, seriously \u2013 what are us kids complaining about?

My vengeful sibling is in the next seat, discreetly but purposefully channeling his breath onto me. He\u2019s on his side, perfectly legitimately, not touching me \u2013 so he\u2019s got me on a technicality. Just breathing? What\u2019s the problem with that? The anger escalates.

The owners\u2019 hope is that people enjoy the experience so much they want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a \nfull-time business: \u2018There\u2019s so much technology. Everybody\u2019s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that\u2019s not just staring at screens. It\u2019s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.\u2019 The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's caf\u00e9 are known as \u2018Eurogames\u2019. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building.\nThe first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan (later rebranded Catan), created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, keeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion, with none of the players feeling left out. That crucial factor was refined in the \u2018co-operative' games that followed, in which every player wins or loses as a team member, provoking a lot more social interaction.\nPandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming\u2019s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. \u2018When I played that with friends we got scared,\u2019 recalls Leacock. \u2018There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.\u2019\nLeacock\u2019s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. \u2018Games were my favourite birthday gift,\u2019 he says, \u2018but I\u2019d get very excited, open up the box, then we\u2019d play and there would just be crushing disappointment.\u2019 So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards of the many games they played together and try to design something better using the same components.\nPandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design. It incorporates, Leacock explains, \u2018a tremendous amount of storytelling. It\u2019s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. It is an unfolding story.\u2019\nThe growth of the video games industry has, perhaps contrary to expectations, been one of the biggest factors in the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games \u2013 largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing. \u2018Video games and board games have learned an awful lot from each other,\u2019 says Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company. \u2018Everyone\u2019s a mobile gamer now. Speak to anyone who\u2019s got a smartphone, they\u2019ve got at least one game they like to play on it. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.\u2019\nFor a time, video-gaming offered a level of physical social interaction, at the arcade or through multi-player sofa games that friends or family members could play at the same time, in the same room. Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. So some people who had previously enjoyed playing video games started looking for a way of playing games again with other people who were physically present. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular caf\u00e9, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world and this trend is set to continue.", "level": "B2", "diff": 64.26, "fac": 0.551714286, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What does Zuzi Morgan say about the board game caf\u00e9?", "answer": "a", "diff": 64.23, "disc": 0.481, "fac": 0.558, "options": {"a": {"text": "It satisfies a basic human need.", "disc": 0.48, "fac": 0.56}, "b": {"text": "Its appeal to customers lies in its originality.", "disc": -0.2, "fac": 0.07}, "c": {"text": "Technology is sometimes a distraction there.", "disc": -0.26, "fac": 0.19}, "d": {"text": "Once people have been there, they tend to return regularly.", "disc": -0.22, "fac": 0.18}}}, "2": {"text": "What does the phrase 'That crucial factor' refer to in line 24?", "answer": "c", "diff": 67.38, "disc": 0.458, "fac": 0.487, "options": {"a": {"text": "all players being part of a team", "disc": -0.4, "fac": 0.46}, "b": {"text": "the option of playing a series of games", "disc": 0.0, "fac": 0.0}, "c": {"text": "every player being involved all the time", "disc": 0.46, "fac": 0.49}, "d": {"text": "the excitement of meeting other players", "disc": -0.13, "fac": 0.05}}}, "3": {"text": "When Matt Leacock designed his game, Pandemic, he hoped that ", "answer": "d", "diff": 50.86, "disc": 0.391, "fac": 0.818, "options": {"a": {"text": "the characters he created for it would be as diverse as in Lord of the Rings.", "disc": -0.37, "fac": 0.1}, "b": {"text": "it would not be as emotionally demanding as Lord of the Rings.", "disc": -0.18, "fac": 0.04}, "c": {"text": "it would encourage players to understand one another better.", "disc": -0.02, "fac": 0.04}, "d": {"text": "players' enjoyment would not depend on the final outcome.", "disc": 0.39, "fac": 0.82}}}, "4": {"text": "What do we learn about Matt Leacock's childhood?", "answer": "c", "diff": 65.1, "disc": 0.441, "fac": 0.539, "options": {"a": {"text": "He hated losing when playing board games.", "disc": 0.01, "fac": 0.08}, "b": {"text": "His uncle introduced him to a wide variety of games.", "disc": -0.38, "fac": 0.34}, "c": {"text": "The games he was given failed to live up to his expectations.", "disc": 0.44, "fac": 0.54}, "d": {"text": "The games he received as presents were rarely what he had asked for.", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.03}}}, "5": {"text": "What is meant by 'unfolding' in line 54?", "answer": "a", "diff": 72.06, "disc": 0.327, "fac": 0.383, "options": {"a": {"text": "evolving", "disc": 0.33, "fac": 0.38}, "b": {"text": "innovative", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.17}, "c": {"text": "absorbing", "disc": -0.26, "fac": 0.08}, "d": {"text": "unpredictable", "disc": -0.02, "fac": 0.36}}}, "6": {"text": "What point is made in the sixth paragraph about new types of board game?", "answer": "b", "diff": 64.81, "disc": 0.454, "fac": 0.545, "options": {"a": {"text": "Those inspired by video games are becoming widespread.", "disc": -0.17, "fac": 0.15}, "b": {"text": "Their popularity is partly due to people's familiarity with video games.", "disc": 0.45, "fac": 0.55}, "c": {"text": "Players find them attractive because they enjoy a change from video games.", "disc": -0.25, "fac": 0.2}, "d": {"text": "They often require players to use skills developed through playing video games.", "disc": -0.15, "fac": 0.09}}}, "7": {"text": "In the final paragraph, the writer suggests that", "answer": "a", "diff": 65.38, "disc": 0.566, "fac": 0.532, "options": {"a": {"text": "board games make up for something that modern video games lack.", "disc": 0.57, "fac": 0.53}, "b": {"text": "there may be a renewed interest in video games in the future.", "disc": -0.21, "fac": 0.13}, "c": {"text": "many people would rather play board games in caf\u00e9s than at home.", "disc": -0.14, "fac": 0.12}, "d": {"text": "video games became less challenging when people started playing online.", "disc": -0.38, "fac": 0.21}}}}}/n{"id": 54, "title": "A career in music\nReporter Eamonn Forde met UK songwriter and music producer Jamie Scott.", "text": "Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits of recent years. His is a story of why endurance and persistence are essential in the music business \u2013 even if, initially, your career seems only to consist of false starts. He says his mother was \u2018an amazing singer\u2019 who also got him started on the guitar. The only radio he heard in his house was a local radio station for middle-aged people, which goes some way to explaining what influenced him as he was growing up. He says he was 12 before he heard a contemporary song. At about the same time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at national level, and music \u2013 he was spending his lunchtimes in the music room at school working out songs on the piano. \u2018With the tennis playing, I was at quite a high level,\u2019 he says. \u2018But it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was just too much hard work.\u2019\nAt 17, he left school to try to make it as a performer. He was part of a duo with a friend who, while not sharing his enthusiasm for making a career out of performing, was a reasonably accomplished guitarist. \u2018I went to my parents and I just broke down,\u2019 he recalls. \u2018I told them this is what I wanted to do, that I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons and I had been playing the piano every day when everyone else was out playing.\u2019 His dad gave him a deadline of 18 months to make it; if he didn\u2019t, he would have to get a job. After a few near misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher when he was 19, off the back of one song. However, record labels were only interested in him as a solo act and so he had to split with his friend.\nIn the end, it was behind the scenes rather than on stage where he would make his name. After a difficult period signed to a record label in the UK, he asked them to let him go and he switched to another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not follow. \u2018It feels like to me in my own artist career that, I\u2019ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of that time,\u2019 he says. \u2018But as a writer I\u2019ve been in the right place at the right time.\u2019\nWriting for others is where he was to really find his feet. \u2018I\u2019d like to think that I am one of the main writers in the UK that UK labels look to send up-and-coming artists to\u2019 he says. This, he believes, helps launch their careers.\nSometimes he has to explain to the artists he's helping that writing with an eye on the charts is nothing to be ashamed of. \u2018Why? Why don\u2019t you want to? Don\u2019t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month? I\u2019m not saying that they should write a bad song, but we should get to something that they think is amazing and that I think is amazing and something that\u2019s likely to sell well too.\u2019\nIt is refreshing in an age of false modesty in the world of pop music to hear someone speak so bluntly about wanting to write huge songs that go to number one. There is no sense of arrogance or entitlement with Scott; he just realised long ago that he wants to write number ones and that he has a natural ability to do it. So, rather than tie himself in knots trying to make himself sound acceptable to other people, he just gets on with it.\n\u2018That\u2019s the endgame for when I go into the studio with someone,\u2019 he says. \u2018Whatever happens, we need to state that this is on the global level and that we need to write the best music of next year.

He\u2019s what\u2019s called a \u2018street trials cyclist\u2019 - for example, he\u2019ll jump from one seemingly impossible location \u2013 a roof, a wall, a ledge of rock \u2013 to land safely in another equally strange location. These stunts are filmed and posted online. \nOn the day I interview him, we meet in a BMX park one Saturday morning. The local boys all know exactly who he is, and we break off a few times while quite a few much older people come and pay their respects too, telling him he\u2019s \u2018an absolute legend\u2019. Not long afterwards, having witnessed some of his skills, I have to agree with their assessment. Despite coming along with a rather sceptical attitude, I\u2019m taken aback by his courage, imagination and willingness to take risks. When he explains before each stunt about what he\u2019s aiming to do, I can\u2019t always believe he\u2019ll pull it off. However, when I enthusiastically compliment him afterwards, he seems indifferent to my warm words and rather downbeat.\nDespite the fame that his online presence has brought him, Tony admits to being an extremely reluctant celebrity. \u2018I find the social side of it difficult. I see the value of being in touch with fans, but instead of discussing things I prefer to actually do them.\u2019 Such an attitude is ironic, given his fame is a product not only of social media but the lightweight camera technology that provides so much of that media\u2019s content. \u2018This technology gives people like me an opportunity to make a living,\u2019 he reflects. \u2018Sometimes I feel everyone is holding a camera at themselves or staring at a screen and part of me doesn\u2019t go along with that.\u2019 However, he\u2019s not complaining. Through the videos he makes a good living out of what, for someone doing anything similar in the past, would have remained a hobby. \nI\u2019ve realised after many years spent interviewing top athletes that there are two important factors that turn an enthusiastic child into an elite competitor: one is energy, and the other is an ability to accept and get over emotional disappointment. These qualities may count for more than talent and they add up to having the mentality to persist in the face of failure. The riskier the sport, the greater the need is to be able to draw on such reserves of mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times when confronted by what were \u2013 by his standards \u2013 fairly easy but unfamiliar obstacles. He just dusted himself down and kept going until he\u2019d mastered the job. \nTony isn\u2019t always seen as a hero. Some people claim he\u2019s reckless and takes unnecessary risks. He says, \u2018The individuals making these accusations may be genuinely concerned but they aren\u2019t well-informed. For a start, they have probably never ridden a trials bike and know nothing about the sport. They have no clear idea about the technical aspects of what I do and don't realise that I get advice from experts so that the risks are minimised.\u2019   \nAnd in fact Tony is far from casual about the risks he runs. \u2018People are all different. Some never get scared and they probably shouldn't be doing these kinds of sports; it\u2019s wise to be aware of the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those that can\u2019t overcome fear and others that can. I\u2019m in the group that feels the fear but finds a way past it.

Still, my wife, Marion, couldn't help but be impressed when I found a gold ring worth \u00a380 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've uncovered has given me pleasure - that sense of being connected to the past is one I've always found satisfying. But after the gold ring, 40 years passed before I made another discovery that impressed Marion as much. \nIt was a dull February afternoon and I had a couple of hours to spare and a location in mind. But it was raining, so I decided to to settle for a closer spot I knew to contain mainly old farming machinery. The first time my detector bleeped, I uncovered a fragment of a metal wheel. Then, as the detector swung on my arm it bleeped again. I tried to ignore it, but couldn't walk away without knowing for sure. \nI'd dug down half a metre and was on my stomach in the mud when a rounded, golden ball became visible. Having dug up brass curtain rails in the past, I tried to keep my expectations in check. But as I brushed more dirt away, the ball resolved itself into a fat, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared. Eventually, I remembered to breathe. I'd seen something like this before - the Great Torc, on display in the British Museum. It\u2019s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain - a period over 2,000 years ago. Torc means \u2018twist\u2019 and it's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring just like the one I was looking at. \nI carried it to the car. At every junction on the drive home, I stared at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. A rinse in my kitchen sink was\nprobably the only clean the torc had had since ancient times. \u2018Marion!\u2019 I shouted, \u2018I've got something for you.\u2019 Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. \u2018What is it?\u2019 she said after a few moments. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery.\nNeither of us tried the torc on; the risk of damaging it was too great. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We'd never been burgled, but anxiety made me restless.  Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office and hid it underneath. The law states that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days of discovery. I was determined to enjoy the torc as much as possible before I gave it up - I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in hospital. Finally, I carried it into the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone as I placed the torc on his desk, and had his back to me. He turned, still talking, then stopped in mid-sentence. \nThe torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's currently in the British Museum in London. The \u00a3350,000 proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself. But the torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say to me, \u2018Now you've made such a fabulous find, I suppose you're going to stop detecting.\u2019 But those brooches and coins are no less interesting now. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop - not while there's the chance of a bigger fish tomorrow.

When friends share details of their intricately planned trips, in which every second of precious travel time is pencilled in with activities, like museums and mountain treks, I smile encouragingly and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include yawningly empty slots for late afternoon naps under sudden Caribbean downpours and lazy mornings nestled between beautiful Italian sheets?\nBetter sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n coast in my early 20s, I was shocked by how many hours \u2013 more than 12 \u2013 I spent sleeping most days. There were lots of noisy birds in the neighboring lot, but it didn't matter. Far from home and from my own bed, surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound, dream-filled, and enjoyable than I imagined possible.\nLiberated from alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep flows more easily. But I don't think simple de-stressing explains why the quality and texture of travel sleep is so dramatically different. My theory is that sleep is actually an extension of our travels, not a pause or respite from them. When traveling, we open ourselves to novel sights, sounds, smells, and ways of being. New and unfamiliar stuff pours into us \u2013 cultures, music, landscapes, even ways of moving through space. It is when sleeping that we wade through this overwhelming river of stimuli. No wonder, then, that sleep becomes so much more intense when we are on the road.\nSleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. \t\tOn the Caribbean island of Trinidad, for example, people awaken at the crack of dawn to get going before the heat sets in, fall into torpor around 10 a.m., when the sun is high, then return to life with the cool evening breezes. Though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, my home base, I still take days to acclimatise to the island's different patterns of sleep and wakefulness.\nWhen, at last, I do fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, when I shared a huge midday meal with a group of new Dominican friends in a big apartment overlooking the blue Caribbean Sea. Weighed down by food and heat, the conversation slowly faded, and finally stopped. One by one my friends abandoned the table to flop on nearby hammocks and sofas. I suddenly understood why my hosts had so many pillows and bolsters on the floor. I grabbed a couple for myself and followed my friends' example. I'd always known about the venerable Latin American custom of the siesta, but that day I experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a slice of Dominican life.\nTravel sleep has another wonderful attribute: it is sleep I remember. Separated by distance and culture from my normal sleep routine, I soon find that I luxuriate in the unexpected fragrances, textures, and sounds that fill my sleeping brain in a new place. If a commitment to \u2018slow travel\u2019 \u2013 enjoying every experience to the full rather than rushing about trying to do everything \u2013 is what now distinguishes the aware modern traveler, well, what is slower than sleep?

And be honest.\u2019 Mia picked up a medium-sized brimmed hat that was softened with a pretty layer of gauze and trimmed with a silk bow, \u2018I still think this one suited you best,\u2019 she said to her customer with well-practised diplomacy.\nWrinkling her nose, the woman scrunched up her face, giving herself the unfortunate appearance of a bulldog. \u2018But it is so boring,\u2019 she said. \u2018Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter\u2019s wedding. Whereas this little beauty will make me stand out from the crowd. Sighing, she patted the red and black miniature top hat that was perched at a jaunty angle on her head. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said decisively, \u2018this is the one I want.\u2019\nMia knew when she was beaten and with a smile firmly in place and agreeing that the woman would indeed stand out from the crowd at her daughter\u2019s wedding, she thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together.\nIt was a while since she\u2019d managed to get everyone in the same place and she was looking forward to seeing Jen and Dan and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her. A friend they knew nothing about, as her husband Jeff had been only too quick to point out when Jen had phoned last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. \u2018Tattie,\u2019 Jeff had said in response to Mia relaying the news, \u2018What sort of name is that?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s short for Tatiana\u2019, Mia had replied. \u2018I think it\u2019s nice.\u2019 \u2018More like something very affected,\u2019 Jeff retorted.\nHer husband had no time for affectation or anything of an ostentatious nature. Nor did he believe in \u2018pussyfooting about\u2019, as he called Mia\u2019s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn\u2019t have held back with this woman in the shop: he would have come right out with the truth and informed her that she was choosing the wrong hat. Moreover, he probably would have said that a dustbin lid would flatter her more. \u2018The trouble with you, Mia,\u2019 he regularly said, \u2018is that you\u2019re much too polite for your own good.\u2019 \nAn hour later Mia had shut up shop and was letting herself in at the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work took all of forty seconds. Four years ago when Luke, the youngest of their children, had left home, Mia had had the idea of converting the unused barn to the side of the house into a light and airy space from which she could run her own business, Jeff had been sceptical. \u2018You really think the demand for hats is out there?\u2019 he\u2019d asked. Mia knew, from listening to friends bemoaning the difficulty of tracking down the perfect hat to complete an outfit for a special occasion, that the demand was most definitely there.\nShe was proved right. From day one, after Jen had helped her to create a website to promote the business, Mia\u2019s Hats was a success.

He might be full of confidence but even he seems mildly stunned by the distance he has travelled from an Olympic final in the discus to the brink of another transformation. Despite never having played American football before, Lawrence appears likely to be picked for one of the major USA teams. \nIn Atlanta, Lawrence is still working out the exact responsibilities of his unfamiliar position. The idea that a 21-year-old novice from London might feature in this year\u2019s selection for one of the biggest teams in American sport, is outrageous. But Lawrence specialises in demolishing disbelief. After being offered a place at Oxford University to study law, he postponed taking it up to train seriously for the discus, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, Lawrence was ranked the world\u2019s fourth-best discus-thrower.\nLawrence had originally travelled to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training. He had been intent on preparing himself for the world championships. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 Lawrence says when asked to confirm the veracity of his sudden leap into a potentially huge NFL contract. \u2018American football was in the back of my mind but it was only when I got to the USA that I made the decision to give it a try. When I was at school in London I also had these thoughts but they seemed crazy at the time.\nSoon after arriving in America he read about the NFL\u2019s trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played the game, did he just imagine he would be good enough to be chosen to attend the Atlanta trials? \u2018Pretty much,\u2019 Lawrence says simply. \u2018I went on the site and applied. He must have been nervous \u2013 being tested alongside men steeped in American football their whole lives? \u2018No,\u2019 he says. \u2018Not at all. I don\u2019t get nervous for many things.\u2019 He is not an effusive talker yet there\u2019s no mistaking his conviction in his abilities. The bare statistics he provided in various tests and drills ensured that he was picked out as the most impressive player. \u2018I was very chuffed to hear that.\u2019 It was the one time that any sign of pride in his talents was evident in Lawrence\u2019s expression.\nYet there is caution, too. Lawrence himself is without even the most basic experience. How can such a raw recruit make it into an NFL team? \u2018From what coaches have told me, I\u2019ve got all the attributes you need. It\u2019s just about how hard I work,\u2019 he replies. Will he be as chilled out as he waits to hear whether he has been selected? \u2018I will be. There\u2019s no pressure on me. Lots of people are saying I\u2019m definitely going to be selected but I\u2019m not too bothered.\u2019\nThis apparent unconcern might have its roots in the disastrous Olympic discus final when he came last. He appears to have recovered from this scarring experience and now takes pleasure in the fact that he qualified for the final, securing his place with an impressive last throw. \u2018That was an amazing day,\u2019 he says. \u2018The final didn\u2019t pan out as I would\u2019ve liked but that\u2019s part of sport. It\u2019s something I can return to.\u2019 After his Olympic disappointment, there was speculation that Lawrence had allowed a momentous occasion to diminish him. Lawrence refuses to comment.\nA minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year and so the economic incentives are plain. So, Lawrence has swapped rugby for athletics and now American football. For all his prodigious physical gifts, would it not be better to just concentrate on one? \u2018I can understand why someone would say that,\u2019 he responds. \u2018I\u2019m trying to accomplish something I\u2019ve dreamed about since I was that schoolkid.  And if it doesn\u2019t work out I can go straight back to the discus, the sport I love.

Looking out of the window onto the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, it had not yet started showing in Siberia. I could see no sign of human life and the view rolled away in an otherworldly blend of mountains, streams and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head.\nMy neighbour woke up and smiled at me sleepily. \u2018Good morning, Robert\u2019 he said, pronouncing my name in a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation in order to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary I had managed to explain to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because it was my intention to return home to England by bicycle. \u2018But, Robert,\u2019 he had reasoned with me, \u2018there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.\u2019 I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road, though not many people used it these days.\n\u2018Alone?\u2019 he asked, pointing at me.\n\u2018No, I will be riding with a friend called Al.\u2019\n\u2018Just one friend?\u2019\n\u2018Yes just one,\u2019 I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and with just one word \u2018Holodna\u2019 (cold) he pointed outside. I tried to bolster my case by explaining to Sergei with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I left out the fact that, because my trip was self-funded I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment had been brought at slashed prices. In reality, I was not at all sure they would be up to the job. This was especially true of my enormous postman\u2019s over-trousers which I had bought for \u00a310.\nIt had all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall that morning was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes, without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? \u2018Well, why not?\u2019 I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, \u2018Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.\u2019 In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to decipher my scrawl, scratched his head, wrote something and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. \u2018OK\u2019, it said.\nIt was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job did tick many important boxes for me. It was frequently challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling and, of course there were great long holidays in which to chase adventures. Twice since I had started teaching I had used these holidays to go to meet Al. He had caught the adventuring-bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and so had decided to do something far more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world.\nEver since that first ride we had taken together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times he thought that the ride, or the road, would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the sceptics who had told him he could not do it.

I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part.\nAn hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets, because tiny objects can become very dangerous during the flight. I also learnt that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout. \u2018The horizon is your best friend,\u2019 I was told, \u2018the pilot will explain in which direction you have to look.\u2019 I was also asked to promise that when I was flying upside down, I would \u2018completely relax. Try and enjoy the view.\u2019 Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not, under any circumstances, to touch anything.\nBy the time we were taxiing down the runway, my legs up in front of me, feet trying not to touch the incredibly important steering pedals, hands trying not to rest on any of the many important switches within reach, my mind had made itself up. Ignoring all instructions received, I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. None of this was of particular comfort as we began accelerating down the runway.\nDario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. There we were in the Zivko Edge 540, upsettingly one of the world\u2019s fastest acrobatic planes, ready to go. The plane took off and two seconds later we banked sharply to the right. It was an instant, violent manoeuvre and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked up at the horizon, tensed everything and emitted short gasps as I sank down into the seat. For a split second I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. And then we levelled out. We turned another sharp left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 metres and my lungs scrunched up on the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 metres off the ground, aiming for the alarmingly small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour but my whoop of momentary excitement was stolen by a sharp right turn. We hadn\u2019t even done any acrobatics yet.\nFor two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, my hand shaking so much the plane shook too\u2026 it\u2019s that responsive. And then after that Dario said something. And I said, \u2018Can you repeat that?\u2019 But instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full lateral 360o turn.\n\u2018Are you okay?\u2019\n\u2018Yup.\u2019\n\u2018Have you had enough?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 I lied.\nThen he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, turning a full circle in the air. Now, I am aware that many people would find this exciting. The sort of people who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I just thought it was a bit much.

If you\u2019ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it\u2019s probably been filmed by him. His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C.  Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. \u2018I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.\u2019\nHe is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. \u2018I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.\u2019 The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. \u2018It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.\u2019\n\u2018My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.\u2019 Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\n\u2018We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera\u2019s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye\u2019s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She\u2019s looking at me but she\u2019s not bothered. I\u2019ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can\u2019t get much better \u2026 when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I\u2019d swear it\u2019s partly in sheer pleasure,\u2019 he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. \u2018Clearly it\u2019s their first view of the world \u2026 It\u2019s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.\u2019\nNow Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand.

Cole Moretonin reports.\n", "text": "In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. That meant swimming through unimaginably cold waters, fighting frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he made it to the South Pole as well. Now he is back in the Arctic again, preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious. Explorers are confident, driven individuals. They have to be. This time, however, there is far more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will set out on a three-month, 1,000 kilometre trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before, and he knows the results will be of vital importance to the scientific community. This will be the truest picture yet of what global warming is doing to the ice that covers the polar region.\nThis is a job he was trained for. When he was a child, Pen was cared for by a woman \u2013 his father\u2019s old nanny \u2013 who had once worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic, and who was hired to toughen the young man up. This she did by sending him out from his home on the Scottish mountains into blizzards and icy gales with as few clothes on as possible. His father passed on a love of frozen adventure, and the boy turned out to have unusual physical endurance.\nPen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a \u2018spine of steel\u2019 and who shares his love of the outdoors. She helps to run his polar guide business and claims to be more worried about him when he\u2019s at home: \u2018He\u2019s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he\u2019s somewhere in the Arctic.\u2019 For fun, she once competed against him in a famous mountain event in which riders on horseback race against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen.\nPen and Mary live in the country with their two children. \u2018It\u2019s much harder to be away from them this time,\u2019 he admits. \u2018They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I thought it would be a good idea to say to my son, \u201cYou\u2019re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.\u201d He absolutely took it to heart, asking his mum how she was all the time, but the strain eventually became too much. While it was well intentioned, it was an unfair thing to do.\u2019 For similar reasons he is planning to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. \u2018If you call them you remind them how far away you are.\u2019\nHe is spending these last days before departure preparing his kit, obsessively. \u2018Out on the ice, one is virtually incapable of mending things or doing anything that isn\u2019t absolutely straightforward,\u2019 he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, one of the world\u2019s leading polar explorers, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will be supported by a crew of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is actually more stressful to someone with his mentality, says Pen, and something else is on his mind too. \u2018I\u2019m going to be 47 on Thursday. I\u2019ve done far less training than I\u2019m comfortable with.\u2019 Why? \u2018Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I\u2019m almost fearful of what I\u2019m going to ask of myself.\u2019\nPen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. \u2018Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition,\u2019 he admits, \u2018and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we\u2019re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what\u2019s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and nobody can do it but us,\u2019 he says. \u2018Our skills, which are otherwise bizarre and socially redundant, have become hyper-relevant.

What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a magical thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Great as that diversity of activities was, however, there wasn\u2019t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. All I knew was that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle\u2019s nagging invitation at the back of my mind: \u2018Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?\u2019\nI have always loved the movement of rowing; the way the boat cuts through the water. I was beginning to miss that feeling, but I still wasn\u2019t ready to commit to the regime of training seven days a week. There was, however, a space in my life and mind for some sort of competition. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn\u2019t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning it? No. On the other hand, there was part of me that thought the chance to be an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I got in contact with Ben.\nBen was going to take part in the race anyway and had somehow scraped together the considerable entry fee and the deposit for a boat \u2013 a fact that made the race a very real possibility, rather than an idle conversation.  We spoke about the remaining costs of the race; the boat and equipment were going to cost \u00a370,000 alone \u2013 a huge amount. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it.\nOn top of the expense of doing the race, of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. Of all the ways to earn money as a retired professional sportsman, speaking at business conferences is one of the most profitable. It is flattering that people are interested. But I find it hard talking about something I\u2019ve done without having another major goal. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn\u2019t just be talking about past achievements. I\u2019d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic.\nI learnt a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full time athlete. Make no mistake, my preparation for the Olympics was tough, my whole life revolving around getting myself in the best possible shape; but looking back it was pretty straightforward. Yes, I was training all day nearly every day, but the training programme was set, there were doctors, dieticians.\nI think if I\u2019m honest, I had concerns over people\u2019s reaction to me doing a race with a TV presenter. I was worried that it would look like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise I would have chosen a better partner to help win the race. My concerns disappeared over the course of our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about far more than just being able to row. This race is more about the mind. Ben had completed the gruelling Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea and a year on a deserted island.\nWhat he can\u2019t do, however, is row.

At 26, I was restless. I was dreaming of Arctic landscapes, cold and bleak expanses, perhaps in reaction to the noise and crowded living of London. So I found a small company run by Anna McCormack, and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, deep in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow (for anything from an hour to a five-day stretch). They started with six dogs, which rapidly expanded to more than 100.\nRecently, they took over a second property \u2013 the 'wilderness farm\u2019, which they wrote was a picturesque but basic outpost with untrustworthy electrics and no running water. I could join the team for three months, they told me, if I knew what I was letting myself in for. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough and the work very physical.\u2019 I started packing straight away.\nNovember 6, London\nOn my flight out I find myself staring blankly at a page of more than 100 shots of huskies; I am meant to have memorised their names by the time I get there, but I am distracted and panicky. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. It is said that spring marches north at a rate of about 26 km per day, a tidal wave of opening flowers and leaves. I think what I am seeing, however, is the opposite movement, with winter marching south, and the rivers freezing over. \nNovember 7, Helsinki and Hetta\nThe bus north is everything I was hoping for. We drive through endless dark forest \u2013 thin conifers, weighed down by snow \u2013 stopping occasionally to let reindeer lumber out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark, and am barely through the door when I\u2019m handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?\u2019 Anna asks. It\u2019s a rhetorical question.\nI follow the sound of barking, which grows to a wall of noise by the time I reach the dogsheds. Three figures are running back and forth up the lines of huskies, pulling them out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too harried to stop and talk much anyway. I hover on the sidelines and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently \u2013 'Get in!\u2019 \u2013 and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command rings out, and with a jerk we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.\nNovember 15, Hetta\nIt does not take long to be initiated into the ranks of the husky guides, but not before a demoralising quizzing on what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?\u2019 Anna asks. I\u2019m stumped. I don\u2019t know. Am I? Further questioning reveals that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven\u2019t done woodwork since school and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?\u2019 someone asks finally. I nod, relieved.\nThe basics of dog-sledding can be picked up very quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don\u2019t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems to be very complicated. Simple tasks such as feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in sub-zero conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup\u2019 of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week my head is spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds \u2013 and from being dragged around myself by overenthusiastic huskies. But I am triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,\u2019 I email friends.

It was noted that her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Intrigued journalists quizzed her on the benefits of a wonderful natural treatment, emu oil. This was a product Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended, to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training.\nRadcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren\u2019t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race. And Hartmann was actually infuriated at this, although he admitted that anyone who didn\u2019t know how fit she was would be thinking it was a risk starting off so fast.\nWith 800m left to run Radcliffe began to calculate. It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking \u2018I can run quicker than that,\u2019 she says. \u2018I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, \u201cI'm going to come back and do it next year\u201d I really did think I would.\u2019 Regrettably that was not to be.\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says \u2018I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.\u2019\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, \u2018Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.\u2019 There was no: \u2018Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?\u2019 \u2018I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session \u2026 Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.\u2019 During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? \u2018Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.\u2019 What does she mean? \u2018That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, \u201cI can relax back,\u201d it was always: \u201ckeep hitting it as hard as you can.\u201d\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak.

There had been plenty of talk going round at the time about the food \u2018revolution\u2019 sweeping through Britain, and I was certain that we\u2019d produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that, but still the question worried me: would people appreciate an approach to cooking that involved not just techniques but also history, nostalgia and science? I watched the first programme in a mixed state of joy and fear.\nI needn\u2019t have worried. The subsequent success of the show paved the way for all sorts of other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project there is a sense of being on a journey, be it into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called \u2018Perfection\u2019, each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these, however, the journey was often a very physical one, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, and in it you\u2019ll zigzag the globe in order to meet some extraordinary artisans, such as a man who finds his true purpose in creating a golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent decades pursuing their own ideals of perfection.\nPerfection is, of course, highly subjective. Even the seemingly simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a nightmare, and I knew I was bound to upset many people by leaving out their particular favourite. \u2018Where\u2019s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?\u2019 I could imagine people saying. Nevertheless, after shutting ourselves away in a meeting room and agreeing not to emerge until we had come up with a suitable list, the TV production team and I eventually had something for everyone.\nThis reinforced my opinion that each of us has our own idea of what constitutes perfection, drawing heavily on a highly personalised mix of emotions, memories and surroundings. Despite the book\u2019s title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn\u2019t be claiming the recipes were in any way \u2018definitive\u2019. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, by talking to food producers and artisans and chefs and their customers, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.\nWhile the dictionary defines \u2018perfection\u2019 as the state of being perfect, it also offers a second definition of equal importance to this book: honing through continual experimentation. Trying out ideas and then revising them until you\u2019ve got something unique. The TV series gave me the opportunity to get out and look into all sorts of foods, people and places I\u2019d never encountered before in any restaurant, and I was as excited about that as I was about the chance to explore memory and nostalgia in food because I started out in this business in exactly the same way.\nSearching out the best ingredients for the recipes took me all over the globe. Among my adventures were: being taken with great solemnity and assurance to a canning factory that turned out to be processing completely the wrong sort of tomato, and visiting a dairy farm whose standards fell so far short of perfection that we had to stop filming there!

The field stretched as far as I could see.  There was nothing much in it, just grass and a lot of flowers. Poppies and daisies.\n\u2018No, we can\u2019t stay here forever,\u2019 I repeated, because it was always safest to be on Bea\u2019s side.  We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing.\nWe sat on the side of the road and watched John grow smaller and smaller as he went off in search of someone who knew something about cars.\nMum stretched out on the grass. \u2018Tell us a story,\u2019 she said.\nBea lay down next to her. \u2018Go on, tell us a story.\u2019\nSo I told them about how on the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them all the things the birds had talked about.  Breadcrumbs. Other birds. The weather. I told them about the argument they had had over a worm. \n\u2018That\u2019s stupid, no-one understands bird language,\u2019 Bea said.\nMy eyes stung. \u2018I do.\u2019 But my voice didn\u2019t sound very convincing.\n\u2018Liar.\u2019\nI flushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every single word?  The more I thought about it, the more I wasn\u2019t sure. \u2018Mum\u2026?\u2019\nBut she had fallen asleep in the sun.\nJohn had returned with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van along the road to the hotel. Bea refused to get out. The boys didn\u2019t seem to mind at all. They waved and smiled at her through the windows in the back door. We followed John into the tiled caf\u00e9. It was set back from the road and was not far from where our van was now parked.\n\u2018It\u2019s a hotel,\u2019 John whispered. \u2018I think it might be a bit expensive.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ll just have some tea,\u2019 Mum reassured him, and we sat down in the shade of the terrace.\nThe tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very, very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. \u2018It\u2019s like syrup in there,\u2019 she said.\nWe stayed at the caf\u00e9 all day while John squinted dismally into the engine. \u2018I suppose it\u2019s a miracle it got us this far,\u2019 he said when it began to grow dark.\nMum dragged blankets out onto the road. She made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to go to sleep on ground that wasn\u2019t rushing away from under you.\n\u2018I\u2019ll have to have us towed into Marrakech,\u2019 John said from the other side of Mum.\nHalf an hour later we were sitting in the truck watching our van trailing behind a rope with John at the wheel. At first Bea hadn\u2019t wanted to move, so John had picked her up and put her in the truck himself. Now she sat in the front with the man who was driving.\nI kept wondering how we\u2019d get home again now that our van had to be dragged everywhere.

They were both older than she was by about ten years, both good enough English speakers to talk about the pieces they were playing, where else they\u2019d travelled recently, and where they were going next. \n\u2018I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,\u2019 Lucy told them. \nIt sounded impressive. Not that she wanted to go to the Tanglewood festival. As she hadn\u2019t wanted to do so many of the things that filled her time: the concerts and competitions that took her around the world and caused her to miss such massive chunks of school that she wasn\u2019t officially enrolled any more. Instead she worked with various tutors from the University of San Francisco.\nShe hadn\u2019t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only took fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she\u2019d made it. There\u2019d been a party. Lucy\u2019s dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn\u2019t even applied. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. \n\u2018I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn\u2019t get in,\u2019 her mom had said. \nRight, Lucy had thought. More like you didn't want to give me the chance to say no. \nThat was when Lucy still believed that rocking the boat was the worst thing a person could do, and it didn't even cross her mind to try to get out of it.\nThe guy from Tokyo leaned forwards as if he had misheard her.\n\u2018Tanglewood?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah.\u2019 \n\u2018How old are you? \n\u2018Fifteen.\u2019 \nHe exchanged a glance with Liesel/Louisa, who said, \u2018Wow.\u2019 \nLucy hadn\u2019t meant to brag. It could be hard to find the line between sharing credentials in an effort to fit in and showing off. \n\u2018It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try...\u2019 \n\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 Liesel/Louisa said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she had to go talk to. Tokyo stayed. \n\u2018Have you ever been to Japan?\u2019 He had long, shaggy hair, like a lot of the guy musicians had, to show the world they may be music nerds but they were rebel music nerds. \u2018Once. When I was, like, eight.\u2019 \nHe started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared at her elbow. \n\u2018Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.\u2019 He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. \u2018And don't get too friendly with the competition.\u2019 \u2018They're not the competition.\u2019\n\u2018Everyone is the competition.\u2019 \nHer grandfather ferried her around the room and made her talk to everyone he thought important. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, hearing about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after they'd left the party, her grandfather turned to her. \u2018You did well in there, Lucy. I\u2019m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there\u2019s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.\u2019 \nShe did like that part. Being somebody. Even if it meant certain people were jealous or thought she was too young to get the kind of attention she did. Being a concert pianist didn't win her any special respect from the kids she\u2019d been at school with.

\nher. So 16-year-old Jodie decided to investigate what the experts think.", "text": "\u2018It\u2019s not good for you to spend so much time online.  You need to get out into the real world,\u2019 said Dad.  He\u2019s difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say \u2013 and it\u2019s quite interesting. Generally, research seems to show that most of us \u2013 teenagers, I mean \u2013 who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says \u2018social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don\u2019t consume media \u2013 dipping in and out to buy airline tickets or check e-mails as adults do \u2013 they inhabit it. That\u2019s neither good nor bad \u2013 it\u2019s what you do with it that counts.\u2019\nHow does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it\u2019s \u2018the modern equivalent of hanging around at the youth club, as today\u2019s parents used to do when they were younger, to share the in-jokes and catch up on the gossip: a kind of virtual youth club.\u2019 He says it performs a similar function: \u2018helping teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learning to deal with teenage issues and get on with their peers.\u2019\nPsychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: \u2018Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity: you can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things. Research actually shows that keen social networkers are not as self-absorbed as others who don\u2019t use social media.\u2019 He says that embracing social media can help if you\u2019re not outgoing: \u2018Computer-mediated communication can be more comfortable than face-to-face, and there may be benefits from practising social skills in a less threatening environment.\u2019\nProfessor Andrew Phillips is researching the use of social networking sites by younger people.  He feels they can help if you\u2019re a quiet person with a specialised interest because they allow you to connect with others with similar interests.  \u2018If you\u2019re one of only three people in your school who\u2019s into a particular type of music, traditionally you would have felt quite isolated.  But if you discover a social networking group of like-minded people, there\u2019s suddenly a necessary critical mass and you can still be popular, just in a different context,\u2019 he says.\nPauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: \u2018It\u2019s people your age who are able to find new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals \u2013 and then create their own content \u2013 who are really harnessing the potential of social networks.\u2019 She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting and blogging about the things that interest us.  Photo-sharing sites, she says, are transforming creativity.  Keen photographers can network with each other, learn skills, swap images and deepen their own interest.\n\u2018This all adds to employability and will undoubtedly be of benefit in the workplace,\u2019 she says.  \u2018Every business is using social media to sell and to increase brand awareness \u2013 and you need to understand how it works and can create customers.  For example, if you develop a product and you have 1000 friends on different social networks, they\u2019re all potential customers for that product.  If you link all those networks together, there\u2019s your customer base.\u2019\nTeenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work, agrees Matthews. \u2018One of the fantastic aspects of many sites is the opportunity for collaborating with others to create content and then share it with others.

However, my parents clearly weren\u2019t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the modern teenager\u2019s worst nightmare: the ultimate family bonding trip. \n\u2018Not enough people do this anymore\u2019 was the line he and my mother spouted in the weeks leading up to our vacation as my twin brother and I shot each other horrified glances that screamed, \u2018Well, there are probably good reasons why!\u2019\nMid-June arrived. We crammed our car full of suitcases, coolers, and a wild assortment of clothing to combat whatever Mother Nature threw at us. Though I was thrilled, I was sure going to miss my privacy for the next two weeks, although I already had a few coping strategies up my sleeve. With barely enough room left for us inside the car, we set off on \u2018The Family Great American Road Trip\u2019. As we left behind our spacious home in favor of more \u201ccozy\u201d accommodations for the next five thousand miles, I wasn\u2019t the only one in the car wondering what we were getting ourselves into\u2026\nWe shot straight west, out through the Oklahoma panhandle. Though still close to home, we were not without our fair share of adventures. My family finally stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest star-filled skies in the nation, but only after nearly being blown off the highway in a dust storm. We quickly learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way! The next day, we were up at dawn and moving again. I sensed a pattern forming.\nDesert gave way to mountains. The days began to blend together, but each adventure was still distinct. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes, and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The heavy smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a taste of what we were going to experience later in our journey. Clinging to the mountainside at one point as we climbed to our next destination, we learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. The fusion of ancient and modern could be seen everywhere we stopped. Dodging construction traffic just became routine. Disappointment turned to laughter as we posed by the enormous \u201cCLOSED\u201d signs in front of the Four Corners Monument.\nWe passed countless wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park where we watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. \u2018Bear jams\u2019, policed by park volunteers, were simply expected while driving through, when traffic would back up to let one cross. And our own close encounter with one on the road (and an anxious park ranger) left us with some unforgettable memories. As we drove on, life back home faded away, and even the hotel we stayed in, with all its inconveniences, couldn\u2019t dent our enthusiasm - a creaky, rustic 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone services. However, in exchange for these, I got to experience the most wonderful views I\u2019ve ever seen.\nAfter watching a rainstorm blow through from a cozy perch in our hotel in Canada, my family and I made our free-fall back south again. My parents had been right. You don\u2019t have to escape to some exotic foreign land to discover something remarkable. It was bittersweet to be home together again, but at least I hadn\u2019t fought with my brother in our one \nhundred hours on the road!

Rose's family was separating for two years. Jeff, Rose\u2019s father, had an assignment overseas, and her mother Dahlia would be joining him, but Rose and her elder sister Amy were staying in England. Amy would spend the next year completing her final school courses, living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school so it would have been unfair on Amy to move. To Amy\u2019s delight, she had been given the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. The free access to the Internet and phone had also not gone unnoticed. Jeff and Dahlia would be keeping an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. \nAnd so Rose was moving to her grandmother\u2019s house. It was only vague holiday memories that Rose recalled of her grandmother, and she had never known her grandfather. When Daisy had offered her granddaughter a place to stay, Rose\u2019s parents had not been enthused by the idea, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble and was relishing the chance to know her granddaughter again. Rose was not entirely sure what her parents enmity was towards her grandma, but there had been a falling out sometime through the years, resulting in summer holidays spent elsewhere instead of with the only other family member that Rose knew. Rose had been only ten years old when she last said goodbye but her memories had been happy ones.\nDahlia had indicated that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was a social go-getter and had an uncanny knack of bringing people together. Within a week, Rose was to expect dinner invitations, coffee morning requests, and shopping trips. The thought of it made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not the typical frail old lady figure, and from what Rose could gather, Daisy seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England herself. \nDahlia and Rose had had a 'talk' prior to the move. Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs. But Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time. Surely she could be trusted to do these small things now? She didn\u2019t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and most of all she didn\u2019t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. \nDaisy had understood. Rose\u2019s mother had duly provided her with a new touch-screen mobile phone complete with video camera for emergencies only, Dahlia had insisted. Rose had been ecstatic. They had all agreed that from now on, it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act mature and make grown-up decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If either of them went too far over the line, they would renegotiate. \nRose had never been a wild child. Her precious few school friends had all been inclined the same way, too, so school reports had always been good and exam results exemplary. This had worked in her favour. In five weeks\u2019 time, Rose would begin the arduous task of starting at a new school, meeting new friends, forming bonds, and basically beginning her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt like a veteran at it now. At least she knew this was the last time as she would be starting her final two years at school.

When I turned 13 I thought: \u2018I may as well attempt this now.\u2019 The novel Charlotte started then is, remarkably, about to be published. \u2018Recently I told my ex-teacher about it and she was astonished. She told me she\u2019d meant I\u2019d probably do it when I was 30 or 40. That had never occurred to me \u2013 I couldn\u2019t understand why I\u2019d be expected to put something on hold that I had a chance of being good at.\u2019\nIt\u2019s a winter afternoon, in the offices of Charlotte\u2019s publishers. Even though I knew that I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still momentarily thrown by seeing a teenager sitting there. The book is a huge achievement: the narrative is assured and action packed. Nothing about it, except the age of its heroine, suggests that it was written by a teenager. The public relations representative for the book is keeping us company in case Charlotte might need defending. But she needs neither parental nor professional support. She\u2019s her own person: spirited, with an alert face and a lively intelligence, but also a steadiness that prevents any overconfidence she could be forgiven for feeling.\nCharlotte acknowledges the limitations of her youth. I ask her about the sophisticated moral issues she raises. \u2018I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. There aren\u2019t many life lessons I can pass on to my readers,\u2019 she responds, laughing. \u2018I don\u2019t think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but neither do I believe I\u2019m particularly wise. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.\u2019\nShe has a theory about teenagers and the way they are \u2018betrayed\u2019 by the fiction that is specifically aimed at them. There are, she maintains, three types of teenager depicted in novels. \u2018There\u2019s the outsider who becomes acceptable to society, the na\u00efve teenager who knows nothing about the big wide world, and the awkward teenage character who isn\u2019t socially skilled.\u2019 Repeatedly reading about these character types irritated her. \u2018What if you\u2019re basically fine? There aren\u2019t many stories out there about characters who aren\u2019t inadequate in some way. The overall impression teenagers can get from some writers \u2013 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intentional \u2013 is teenagers can\u2019t possibly know who they are because they\u2019re not experienced enough to know the truth. And when that is being pushed on them by writers, it can undermine their self-belief\u2019.\nCharlotte has always been a keen reader of famous fantasy writers, some of whom you might suppose she\u2019d be indebted to, but in fact they almost put her off writing entirely. \u2018Books by my favourite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and about life. I was asking myself: is this seriously what I have to be doing to write a good book and am I really up to it?\u2019 She does, however, praise the influence of a book called How Not to Write a Novel. \u2018It tells you that if the reader starts to guess what\u2019s going to happen, the suspense has probably gone.\u2019\nIt would be easy to argue that Charlotte\u2019s parents both being journalists was the decisive factor in getting her novel published.

Then one guy, David, who\u2019d had some experience of freestyle ski-jumping, and presumably wanted to preserve his reputation as someone who knew exactly what he was doing, soon pushed forward, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Even to our untutored eyes, something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. \u2018Remember,\u2019 Gareth then kindly informed us, \u2018speed is an unpredictable beast.\u2019\nPerhaps I just wasn\u2019t cut out for this freestyle stuff. On previous skiing holidays, I\u2019d enjoyed messing about, practising turns in the snow. I just wasn\u2019t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. Deep down, I'd always thought it looked fun, but reckoned that, with my lack of know-how, if I\u2019d tried to join with the skateboarders, with their baggy trousers and special language, I\u2019d have risked total ridicule.\nThen my parents decided we\u2019d have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, from which students leapt, shrieking attempted their new tricks, then landed in pits of foam cubes \u2013  hardly a realistic introduction to what lay ahead of us out on the slopes. After practising their moves indoors, students headed outside to try them for real. \u2018Progression is inevitable!\u2019 the centre\u2019s slogan cheerily assured us. \u2018Before places like this trained people up, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,\u2019 said Gareth. \u2018But remember \u2013 once you\u2019re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you\u2019ll be in trouble.\u2019\nThe \u2018knuckle\u2019 Gareth was referring to is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again to become the landing zone proper.  Land in the zone and your motion continues forward, minimising impact. Land on the flat and you stop dead, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, though, it was all but impossible to convince my body to ignore what my brain was screaming at me and to race straight towards the jump. My legs would virtually go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came slamming down onto the knuckle. I managed not to fall but by midday I felt several centimetres shorter. \u2018You need to control the jump, not let it control you,\u2019 said Gareth. \nDay two started on the trampolines in the centre. I'd expected to hate being stuck indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some of the drills copied moves we\u2019d make while ski-jumping, others were aimed at teaching \u2018aerial awareness\u2019 \u2013 knowing what your body was doing as you spun in space. Gareth gave us a running commentary. My \u2018aerial awareness\u2019 apparently needed work \u2013 and it\u2019s true that, every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and nothing more until I found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.\nWe moved back to the mountain to try again. Inevitably, there were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as delighted as me, and for a few moments I was walking on air, with the sheer pride of having achieved such an elusive goal. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to reduce speed as I approached the jump, became airborne,  and came down appropriately in the landing zone.

Palms clammy with fear, nails digging into the harness, you come to a grinding halt and inhale sharply before the carriage creeps slowly upwards. A pause. Then a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. Teeth gritted, you hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, then upside down. Your senses a blur, you let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut. But you only have yourself to blame: after all, like hundreds of millions of others each year, you were happy to pay the price of getting into a theme park.\nWhat\u2019s somewhat mystifying to me is that amusement parks, with their hair-raising rides aimed at pulling in crowds, are a huge industry. To deliver the thrills and ultimate-escape-from-reality that guests seek, behind the scenes there are huge teams of highly inventive \u2013 and arguably a little cruel \u2013 structural, mechanical, industrial and electrical engineers, as well as designers and marketing experts.\n\u2018Rollercoaster designer\u2019 sounds like the career aspiration of a primary school child when asked what they want to be when they grow up. In reality, it\u2019s a big challenge: not just creating the perfect balance of pleasure and fear while ensuring that passengers are not in any danger; but also introducing enough novelty to keep visitors wanting more.\nFor, while the layperson may imagine that rollercoasters have become ever more intense, in fact most of the techniques used today \u2013 including the wheel that allows rides to go upside-down \u2013 were invented by the US designer John Miller in the early 20th century. In his pre-regulation \u2018golden age\u2019, the extremities of rollercoasting were explored \u2013 to the discomfort of many passengers \u2013 but now creators are limited to the track designs offered by specialist ride manufacturers.\nI spoke to three experts on rollercoasters. \u2018The skill,\u2019 said Professor Brendan Walker, a \u2018thrill engineer\u2019 with a background in aeronautics, \u2018is in compiling the pieces.\u2019 And what that means, said Dr John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, is \u2018swapping very rapidly between plus and minus, so people get the sense of being sort of thrown around but kept safe. It\u2019s a very fine line between people feeling the ride is thrilling and that feeling they\u2019ve been bumped around.\u2019\nIn the search for a superlative ride, the teams behind rollercoasters must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle, that works with any innovations \u2013 the tallest ride, the most twists, the steepest drops \u2013 to create a seamless experience. However, said Professor Walker, in the end, as in many creative industries, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work. \u2018It helps to be a bit of a thrill-nut if you are designing rollercoasters, in order to understand exactly what passengers are looking for, and to test your rides before they are opened to the public,\u2019 agreed Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development.\nSurely, though, I asked them, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality? Walker said we shouldn\u2019t hold our breath. \u2018Virtual reality can add a veneer, but only in the way that an old fashioned rollercoaster was fantastically painted,\u2019 he said. \u2019New technology comes along all the time, and the parks are very quick to embrace it because it is exciting and can add to ride experience. But underpinning that is the physical coaster experience, and I think that will remain king for many years to come.\u2019", "level": "B2", "diff": 68.05714286, "fac": 0.542571429, "questions": {"1": {"text": "What does the writer say in the first paragraph about people who ride on rollercoasters?", "answer": "b", "diff": 69.55, "disc": 0.316, "fac": 0.507, "options": {"a": {"text": "They spend too much money trying to find excitement.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "They can't complain when they feel terrified.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "They often don't realise how frightening the experience will be.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "They should try to control their emotions more effectively.", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "2": {"text": "What do we learn in the second paragraph about the writer's attitude towards rollercoasters?", "answer": "d", "diff": 60.17, "disc": 0.34, "fac": 0.714, "options": {"a": {"text": "He is concerned that they may have a negative effect on passengers.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "He believes they promise more excitement than they can deliver.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "He regrets that people feel the need to spend their leisure time in this way.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "He finds it hard to understand why so much effort is put into creating them.", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "3": {"text": "What is suggested about rollercoaster designers in the third paragraph?", "answer": "c", "diff": 63.58, "disc": 0.518, "fac": 0.643, "options": {"a": {"text": "They have had the courage to follow their dreams.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "They should try harder to please theme park visitors.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "They deserve credit for doing a demanding job effectively.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "They are not the kind of people who can be taken seriously.", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "4": {"text": "What point is made in the fourth paragraph?", "answer": "a", "diff": 81.74, "disc": 0.071, "fac": 0.244, "options": {"a": {"text": "Rollercoasters are less exciting than they once were.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "Modern day rides rely on out-of-date technology.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "There were more restrictions on designers in the past.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "People have criticised the lack of innovative rollercoaster designs.", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "5": {"text": "What is emphasised by 'it's a very fine line' in line 47?", "answer": "d", "diff": 64.87, "disc": 0.507, "fac": 0.615, "options": {"a": {"text": "how very unpredictable people are", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "the speed at which so many rides can go", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "the possible risks involved in going on a ride", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "how difficult it is to get a ride exactly right  ", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "6": {"text": "What does 'that' refer to in line 53?", "answer": "b", "diff": 67.14, "disc": 0.372, "fac": 0.563, "options": {"a": {"text": "a superlative ride", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "a strong narrative", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "a space adventure", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "a high-paced chase", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}, "7": {"text": "What does Walker suggest about new technology in the rollercoaster industry?", "answer": "c", "diff": 69.35, "disc": 0.442, "fac": 0.512, "options": {"a": {"text": "Designers are reluctant to use it.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "b": {"text": "It has proved problematic in the past.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "c": {"text": "It has a limited role to play.", "disc": null, "fac": null}, "d": {"text": "Passengers rarely notice its impact.", "disc": null, "fac": null}}}}}/n{"id": 115, "title": "Interview with a young choreographer\nMartin Fields talks to Miranda Ellington about her life and work.", "text": "At 25, Miranda Ellington has already achieved a great deal as a choreographer, creating works for a long list of theatres and dance companies. On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I\u2019m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. \u2018Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it\u2019s like to be rehearsing all day long,\u2019 she tells me. \n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. \u2018A dancer who\u2019s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they\u2019re open to taking risks. They\u2019re hungry for success, but they don\u2019t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.\u2019 \nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. \u2018There may be a piece of music I\u2019m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren\u2019t responding well to a particular composer\u2019s music, that can be frustrating, but I\u2019m still required to find solutions. That won\u2019t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I\u2019d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces \u2013 it\u2019d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I\u2019m always working on big productions \u2013 the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn\u2019t negotiable.\u2019 \nMiranda really doesn\u2019t believe in attaching herself to one institution. \u2018I do feel it\u2019s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.\u2019\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. \u2018There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,\u2019 says Miranda. \u2018This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she\u2019s not getting it right but just can\u2019t make her body do what\u2019s required. It\u2019s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.\u2019\nI\u2019m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. \u2018It\u2019s when everything the company has invested in \u2013 the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers \u2013 all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I\u2019ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that\u2019s just disappointing.\u2019\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? \u2018People seem to want to put a label on you and I can\u2019t quite understand that. And there\u2019s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too. I tend not to go along with that, though the time may come when I\u2019m happy to have a reputation largely for doing one thing.
