<h1>Editing dictionaries</h1>

The data file and the index file used by the server are generated from
base data in plain text or HTML format. These base data can be edited
with a UTF-8 capable editor. After editing you need to generate the
data and index file again. The following example explains how it can
be done for Tu Dien Su Dia. The data for TD Su Dia are contained in
several text files: utf8_a.txt, utf8_b1.txt, utf8_b2.txt ...

<ul>

<li>The first step is to create a file (e.g. tdsudia.txt) containing
the names of the files. (In this way you can create the dictionary
using only parts of the data if you do not want to include all
utf8_*.txt files).</li>

<li>run td-index.bat</li>

<li>Click "Find" and select tdsudia.txt. The field "List of source
files" will now contain the fully qualified name of tdsudia.txt, and
the fields "Data file", "Index file" and "Config file" will contain
the names tdsudia.dict, tdsudia.index and tdsudia.ini (with full
path). It is recommended that you keep these defaults. Make sure to
remove old versions of the files tdsudia.dict and tdsudia.index</li>

<li>Select the format of the headwords used by this dictionary. In
this case it is headword#1# (TD Su Dia). It is how the headwords are
marked in the files utf8_*.txt (When editing them please use this
format for new entries: headword## if there is only one definition or
headword#n# if there are more.)</li>

<li>You can give the dictionary an ID (in the ID field) and a name
(the name field), e.g., vsd as ID and TD Su Dia as name.</li>

<li>Click "Run". After a while the data, index and configuration files
are created.</li>

<li>Now you can use the newly edited dictionary by augmenting
vietdict.bat with the config file tdsudia.ini (If you move the data
and index files to new locations please modify the ini file
accordingly.) </li>

</ul>

Note: if you replace vietdict23.jar with vietdict24.jar in
vietdict.bat, the file form.html will be recreated for you every time
the server is started.
